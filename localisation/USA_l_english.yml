 POLITICS_NORMAN_THOMAS_DESC:0 "A Princeton graduate and Presbyterian minister, Norman Thomas made his first impression in politics with his pacifist, anti-war activism during the Great War, a position that drew him to the Socialist Party of America, who had delivered on their promises to keep America out of it. He gained popularity as an SPA journalist and was elected governor of New York in 1924. When Eugene V. Debs died in 1926, Thomas became the new head of the party as its leading non-immigrant member. He lost his first bid for president to Herbert Hoover in 1928, but after the Stock Market crash in 1929, Hoover’s popularity plummeted, and in 1932 President Norman Thomas and the SPA won the Presidency in a landslide. For all of his term, Norman Thomas has set about fixing the Great Depression with large amounts of government spending, public works projects, bureaucratic expansion, and worker-led recovery efforts. His recovery policies have been hindered and watered down by political resistance from the center and right wing, but where they have been enacted, have been both successful and popular."

 ### General USA Flavor Events
 united_states_flavor.2.desc:0 "There is one day every year which the reactionaries of the world all despise with a passion. The one day in which the masses routinely come together as one and make the world tremble before their combined power: May Day, the day of the workers.\n\nAround the world, in Seattle, Chicago, New York, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, London, Madrid, Paris, Berlin, Warsaw, Moscow, and Tokyo, the workers spill forth from their apartments, slums, and factories to fill the streets with flowing parades, red and black banners fluttering as the air is filled with the International, the Commonwealth of Toil, and the Worker's Marseillaise.\n\nThe forces of reaction and capital cower in their gilded halls of crime, and wait out the storm that is the day of the working class."
 
 ### Thomas ###
 ### Campaign events from intro tree ###
 united_states_thomas.1.desc:0 "Thomas ascended his platform in front of a massive crowd; ten thousand people at least. A deafening roar of approval washed over him as he stepped into sight of the crowd. Taking a moment to shake hands with fellow Socialist Party member and mayor of the city, Fiorello La Guardia, he then stepped forward in front of the microphones.\n\n"Working men and women of New York city and state, it is an honor to stand before you today!"\n\nAnother wave of applause and cheers washed over him.\n\n"I stand today amidst a red metropolis! New York City, under the leadership of La Guardia and with the aid of its countless socialist inhabitants, has excised corruption from the city council, has cast down the petty oligarchs of Tammany Hall, has dragged vile gangsters to prison, and has built vast public works that are the envy of even such cities as London, Paris, and Berlin! New York is a shining beacon to the nation and the world; a beacon of socialist promises made and fulfilled to their greatest extent! New York is the city of the future!"\n\nHe paused as the applause once again grew deafening. This was mostly theater; New York City itself was a clinch for the Socialist Party, and had been since the twenties. There wasn’t much proper campaigning to be done here. Still, it felt quite good to stand before tens of thousands of people and make a little victory lap. Smiling to himself, he continued his speech."
 united_states_thomas.2.desc:0 "President Thomas walked up on stage. He looked over the crowd and hesitated. It seemed to be one of the largest crowds he had ever spoken to, easily numbering in the thousands. He began to sweat. He had always been an author first, not a public speaker. Still, these were mostly striking workers and SPA voters. It should go smoothly, he thought.\n\n"Good afternoon, Flint, Michigan!" Thomas said cheerfully into the microphone. The crowd roared. "I hear you boys have done a mighty fine job of organizing. Been on strike for 3 weeks? Good on you, men. Good on you." He chuckled slightly. "I read an interview in the paper last week with Alfred Sloan, the big boss here at GM." He gave the crowd time to jeer at his name. "He seemed awfully nervous about the strike. I think you all have got him on the run!" The crowd cheered and hollered more, waving their signs.\n\nOn them were written all sorts of slogans, quotes from Marx, and insults at Mr. Sloan and local management. There were large banners colored black and red with SPA and IWW symbols emblazoned on them. As President Thomas looked over the cheering crowd, full of workers with both their fists and voices raised, he was proud. This is what he wanted America to look like. Thousands of working people, united in their knowledge of their own interests and needs. As he drifted off into thought, he realized that he had been silent for some time and the cheering was dying down.\n\n"You know, Alfred Sloan mentioned me in that interview with the Times," Thomas said, forming a sly smile. "He said, 'all this anarchist worker agitation is the fault of these socialists in office.'" The crowd began to boo. "Now wait, folks," the President spoke over them. "He gave me the best compliment I’ve received in all my time in office. He said, 'Because of the labor laws put forward by that communist Norman Thomas, my hands are tied and I can’t do anything to stop this strike.'" The President laughed. "And if that isn’t a reason to be proud of what we in the SPA have achieved, nothing is!"\n\nThe crowd went wild, cheering so loudly that Thomas almost felt pushed back by their sheer volume, and as he looked over the faces of all the uncountable number of striking workers, he knew that Alfred Sloan was right to be afraid, because these workers were the finest that American labor had to offer. As he looked on with pride, a chant was picked up in the crowd, and Thomas wiped a joyful tear from his eye."
 united_states_thomas.3.desc:0 "The President looked across the camp. The people watching him were thin as twigs and seemed to lack all spirit. The way Labor Secretary Perkins explained it to him did not show the reality of the situation at all. She said that in California there was a surplus of migrant workers and a shortage of jobs, so wages were low and conditions were bad. Her briefing did not prepare Thomas to see the absolute destitution and misery that this migrant work camp displayed. Dozens of eyes were upon him as he stood in front of a small crowd.\n\n"So, where are you all from?" Thomas asked, forcing an awkward smile.\n\n"We’re from Oklahoma," said one woman in the crowd. "We came here for work, and there ain’t none."\n\nThomas was taken aback by the bluntness of her words. No one had spoken to him like that before. "Well, there’s a government camp just a few miles north of here that’s a part of the Recovery Acts. They can give you work and see to your needs if you wish."\n\n"That’s where I came from!" yelled a man from the back of the crowd. "They ain’t got the money to pay us or food to feed us! It looks just like here, except the coppers harass ya when you try to get in!"\n\nThomas looked on in shock. "The police are opposing the Recovery?" he asked incredulously. A few people in the crowd laughed at his disbelief.\n\n"‘Course they are," said a teenage boy. "All the coppers ‘round here are crooked. The planters pay ‘em more than the state does. All they do is harass us, and wave guns at anyone who tries to organize."\n\n"Just two days back, they shot my brother for strikin’!" a young girl cried. "Killed him dead!"\n\nThomas looked to one of his aides. "It’s much worse here than I thought. We should go." He gave a brief farewell to the crowd and turned to walk away. As he did, however, a woman pushed his way past his bodyguards and grabbed him by the arm.\n\n"Mister President, sir," she pleaded to him. "It’s so much worse here than it looks. I’ve fed grown men here with my own breast milk because they’d starve to death otherwise. We want a recovery, sir, so, so badly, but we ain’t getting one here." She let go of his arm as tears began to flow from her eyes. Norman opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. After a few moments, she turned and walked back to the crowd."
 united_states_thomas.4.desc:0 ""
 united_states_thomas.5.desc:0 "President Thomas stood on a podium before a large crowd of working men on an unused dock, where his platform had been set up. There were at least four hundred people in attendance, a fair number. He’d speak to thousands before his time in Chicago was finished.\n\nThe city’s main industries were meat packing and metalworking, and his speech had been planned accordingly. What hadn’t been planned for was the fact that a significant minority of the people who appeared at his rallies in the city were African American.\n\nUpon asking, he’d been informed by a black campaign aid that this was because of something called the “Great Northward Migration”. Its causes were varied but predictable; racial violence and lack of economic opportunity in the South were driving African Americans norward to seek employment in Northern cities, like Chicago. With this in mind, he’d adjusted his speeches accordingly.\n\n"Working men of Chicago!" He began, addressing the crowd with a warm smile. "We stand in a city built by your toil. A city of towering buildings, massive factories, and sprawling stockyards; all great monuments to progress. But they are more than that. They are monuments to labor; your labor! For too long, rich men in those tall buildings have decided your fate for you. They have taken the fruits of your labor and used them as they saw fit! They have built libraries and opera houses and theaters and hotels. But what good are libraries when your children cannot read? What good is opera and theater when your meager pay cannot buy you a ticket? What good are hotels when you don’t have the time for vacation?"\n\nFrom among the crowd came grumbled agreement; heads nodding, eyes locked on Thomas as he gave voice to their frustrations.\n\n"Comrades, the Socialist Party of America hears you! If we are given your mandate, we shall ensure that no longer will your hard labor go towards luxuries that you yourself are denied! Your children will have schools, your family will have the money for entertainment and cultural edification, and you will have generous time away from work to spend at your leisure! The Republicans and Democrats have had decades to fulfill these same promises, and they have lied time and time again. The Socialists are a worker’s party, your fate is ours! We will never forget you, and never abandon you!"\n\nThere as a generous round of applause, and hollers of support arose from the assembly.\n\nSwallowing nervously, Thomas began the second part of his speech, careful not to let the nervousness make his voice waver. "I see assembled before me today members from both races of America, black and white. No matter where we hail from, we are all Americans, drawn here by God-given opportunity. At time like this, where the segregationists seek to divide the working class along artificial lines and make it tear itself apart so that a few tycoons and tyrants might profit, we must remember that we are all in this fight together, regardless of race or creed! God bless America, and God bless the working class!"\n\nThe applause was louder now, supplemented by cheering, although Thomas suspected that it was more from his invocation of god than his preaching about racial equality. Either way, it made him smile."
 united_states_thomas.6.desc:0 "President Thomas wiped the sweat off the top of his head. His underarms were also stained with it, as he baked in the Louisiana sun. It didn’t seem to be phasing Senator Huey Long at all though, who was still giving a lively diatribe. "I know President Thomas wants to help the common people, he really does, and I admire that. But how much has his red Recovery really done for them? Something, sure, but not enough! Certainly nowhere near as much as my Share Our Wealth plan would!" The crowd murmured in agreement.\n\nThomas cut in. "I like your Share Our Wealth program, I really do! I wish my Recovery plan could look more like it," he said. The crowd looked with curiosity. "In fact, maybe it could, if Huey Long and his fellow AFP members would support it so that we didn’t have to compromise with the Republicans and Democrats for votes!" The crowd had been captured. Thomas had always been a more talented author than public speaker, but he had a chance here. He could make them cheer. He turned to Long. "But how is it that you think you can collectivize the capital of a society without collectivizing the means by which that capital is produced?" The crowd was silent. Titled heads and raised eyebrows were all that met his gaze. He lost it.\n\nLong pounced. "Now what in blazes is that supposed to mean? You’re talkin’ about socialism? Now there’s a good reason we don’t do socialism." Long smiled and spoke more loudly to the crowd. "Cause socialism destroys nations! We’ve seen what socialism did to Russia, and it’s a good thing that America remains a democracy or they’d do the same thing here! Our opposition is the only thing saving America from a red terror!" The crowd roared and cheered.\n\nLong softened his tone. "Capitalism isn’t just an economic system, folks. It’s a God-given mandate for the American people that dates all the way back to the Israelites and the Ten Commandments. 'Thou shalt not covet.' These reds, folks, they covet everything. Under socialism, you wouldn’t even get to own your own garters." The crowd nodded in agreement. President Thomas knew he couldn’t compete with Long’s oratories ability, even though Long was talking nonsense. He tried to draw on his religious education as he moved into a half-hearted and poorly received rebuttal."
 
 ### Work events from intro tree ###
 united_states_thomas.7.desc:0 ""When we lose the next war, and an American boy, lying in the mud with an enemy bayonet through his belly and an enemy foot on his dying throat, spits out his last curse, I want the name not to be MacArthur, but Thomas!" MacArthur screamed. The news that the Army's budget was to be cut by 51% was just too much.\n\n"You must not talk that way to the President!" Thomas yelled back. He could tolerate criticism, but MacArthur had gone too far this time.\n\n"I don't give a damn! If you will not reconsider this stupidity, then I offer to resign! I will not be responsible!"\n\n"So be it then! I accept your resignation!"\n\nMacArthur froze. He could feel a rumbling in his stomach. He quickly made an about-face and stepped out of the office, the argument clearly over. His head was swimming. He needed air. He'd barely staggered out of the front door when it hit. He doubled over, and promptly vomited on the front steps of the White House."
 
 ### SECOND TERM THOMAS EVENTS ###
 united_states_thomas.9.desc:0 "President Thomas stared down at the sheet of paper on his desk, looking over the names that had been drawn up for potential cabinet appointments.\n\nThe election results had been good, but not perfect, and had planted a seed of doubt in the president’s mind. If the Socialist Party was truly to become America’s leading party then it would need popular support. More so, at least, than it currently had.\n\nThomas stared down at the list and smiled. It was a grand who’s who of socialist mainstays, from W.E.B. Du Bois to Emma Goldman.\n\nIt was a radical list, to be sure. A more radical government had never been assembled since Lincoln’s day. But these were radical times, and it wouldn’t do to stick with stodgy liberal-capitalist political thinking. That was a dying breed, and Thomas had no wish to resuscitate it.\n\nThe cabinet he was putting together would be unconventional, and Goldman’s inclusion would definitely raise some eyebrows, but it would show the people that, without a doubt, the Socialist Party was committed to socialism and the liberation of all men and women.\n\nThat was the only real way to gain popular support, Thomas decided, leaning back in his chair with a smile on his face. Appeal to the people directly, and show them that the Socialist Party had their interests at heart first and foremost, not the pleadings and mutterings of the capitalist parties."
 united_states_thomas.10.desc:0 ""It’s a racket. That’s the long and the short of it." Major General Smedley Butler said plainly, addressing President Thomas. "It’s part of a scheme the tycoons cooked up to get you out of power. The first step was causing the economy to crash again, on purpose this time. Then they came forward to me, and asked me to lead a coup against you. They think I’m popular, and they came to me because I led capitalist interventions in Latin America to prop up business interests there. They thought I’d be willing to do the same here; to get me to lead an army of veterans, organized through the American Legion, into Washington, coup the government, and install a fascist dictatorship."\n\n"And, since you’re sitting here telling me this, would I be correct in assuming that you’re not?"\n\n"You would be correct, sir."\n\nThere was a long moment of silence. President Thomas rubbed his temples, sighing. "Thank you for telling me, General Butler. I’m very grateful for your faith in my administration. I understand that you have some reservations about our more radical policies, but your loyalty to the Constitution in spite of us is outstanding."\n\nButler merely nodded.\n"Who do you know for sure was in on the conspiracy?"\n\n"Henry Ford, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, Gerald C. MacGuire, Bill Doyle, Grayson Murphy, and Robert Sterling Clark. They’re the ones I met in person. They mentioned others, I have a full list in a notebook."\n\n"I’ll inform the FBI and have a House committee look into the matter." Seeing Butler open his mouth, Thomas cut him off. "I know, I know. They might be compromised; capitalist influence is still strong, especially in the FBI, but it’s our only course of action that won’t cause a constitutional crisis.""
 united_states_thomas.11.desc:0 ""They say they can’t find any solid evidence." Thomas shrugged, looking across the Resolute Desk at General Butler. "I don’t believe them, of course. From what I can see from here, they did the bare minimum they could get away with and then declared the case closed."\n\nButler sighed, leaning back in his chair. "It was perhaps foolish of me to think that we could catch the racketeers in the act. They cover their tracks too well."\n\n"The FBI noted that they couldn’t confirm the locations of the people you mentioned at the time you said that you were meeting with them, but people hardly leave their schedules lying around anyway, and 'not being where we think you ought to be' isn’t a crime nor is it particularly compelling evidence of a crime, so my hands are tied here, Smedley. The best we can do is stay vigilant. I’m shuffling the military administration to ensure that there are loyal men in key strategic positions, should the worst happen, but otherwise we are without recourse at the moment."\n\nThe general nodded. "You can count on my loyalty in such a situation, Mr. President, as much as I pray it won’t come to pass." His commander-in-chief dismissed him, and the general stood to gather his coat. Looking over his shoulder, he said. "And I’m sorry about the negative press all this has brought on you. You’ve probably seen the New York Times, calling us and the congressional committee a gang of witch-hunters."\n\nThomas sighed. "It’s nothing new, I assure you. The capitalist press has never been friendly to socialists. We’ll weather the storm like all that have come before it, and come out stronger than before."\n"Indeed. Good day, Mr. President.""
