 POLITICS_NORMAN_THOMAS_DESC:0 "A Princeton graduate and Presbyterian minister, Norman Thomas made his first impression in politics with his pacifist, anti-war activism during the Great War, a position that drew him to the Socialist Party of America, who had delivered on their promises to keep America out of it. He gained popularity as an SPA journalist and was elected governor of New York in 1924. When Eugene V. Debs died in 1926, Thomas became the new head of the party as its leading non-immigrant member. He lost his first bid for president to Herbert Hoover in 1928, but after the Stock Market crash in 1929, Hoover’s popularity plummeted, and in 1932 President Norman Thomas and the SPA won the Presidency in a landslide. For all of his term, Norman Thomas has set about fixing the Great Depression with large amounts of government spending, public works projects, bureaucratic expansion, and worker-led recovery efforts. His recovery policies have been hindered and watered down by political resistance from the center and right wing, but where they have been enacted, have been both successful and popular."

Though they have not been able to fully implement their agenda due to liberal and right-wing resistance, America has been changed by their radical pro-worker policies. Radical left-wing ideas are popular and normalized, which has in turn fostered greater radicalism on the right."

These are but a few examples of the courts disdain for equality.\n\nThere are 13 federal circuit courts, yet only 9 justices. Our planned bill will increase the number of justices to match, it only makes sense. The capitalists can cry all they want about 'tyranny', 'overreach', or 'checks and balances', but we know that these are just excuses to delay the birth of a new, better America."
 USA_strengthen_executive_branch_desc:0 "The nature of the legislative branch makes passing the bills we desire in their purest form impractical;they'll be watered down and rendered toothless by the time they come out the other end, a stumbling block that even Debs was unable to surmount. So, the reasoning goes, we must strengthen the executive branch. Now it must be made clear not just to the public but also to members of our party that this is not some power-grab by President Thomas; we've learned valuable lessons from the Russians, and we shall not repeat Lenin's mistake of centralizing too much power in too few people. Once the revolution is complete, we shall set things back to their normal course, and a true, socialist democracy shall reign. Until then, we need to be able to practically enforce our vision, over the protests of do-nothing bourgeoisie liberals if we must."

The Supreme Court has always been a political tool and an instrument of repression, giving us such national embarrassments as the Dred Scott ruling, and constantly working against the people's interests. It's not even their place to decide what is and isn't constitutional; they gave themselves that power! Who even are the lawmakers around here anyway?! The people have chosen us; have chosen our vision! Nothing will stop us now, not even the court! Their legitimacy dried up long ago, and our voters would never forgive us if we stopped now. The path ahead is clear: Stack the court with an unassailable socialist majority, change a few names on our bills and executive orders, and send them through again to get approval. This is simpler than it sounds; we don't even need to create too many new seats; just accuse a few of the more questionable justices of treason, bribery, or some high crime or misdemeanor, and replace them promptly.

 ### General USA Flavor Events
 united_states_flavor.2.desc:0 "There is one day every year which the reactionaries of the world all despise with a passion. The one day in which the masses routinely come together as one and make the world tremble before their combined power: May Day, the day of the workers.\n\nAround the world, in Seattle, Chicago, New York, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, London, Madrid, Paris, Berlin, Warsaw, Moscow, and Tokyo, the workers spill forth from their apartments, slums, and factories to fill the streets with flowing parades, red and black banners fluttering as the air is filled with the International, the Commonwealth of Toil, and the Worker's Marseillaise.\n\nThe forces of reaction and capital cower in their gilded halls of crime, and wait out the storm that is the day of the working class."
 
 united_states_flavor.3.desc:0 ""It will not have escaped the notice of those who have often corresponded with me that, for much of my life, I have held certain ideas about class, race, and culture that some would consider backwards. I can better understand the inert blindness & defiant ignorance of the reactionaries from having been one of them. I know how smugly ignorant I was—wrapped up in the arts, the natural (not social) sciences, the externals of history & antiquarianism, the abstract academic phases of philosophy, and so on—all the one-sided standard lore to which, according to the traditions of the dying order, a liberal education was limited. God! the things that were left out—the inside facts of history, the rational interpretation of periodic social crises, the foundations of economics and sociology, the actual state of the world today... And above all, the habit of applying disinterested reason to problems hitherto approached only with traditional genuflections, flag-waving, and callous shoulder-shrugs!\n\n"I sit and write now a changed man. While once I sneered at liberals for what I saw as their their degeneracy and blind optimism, and the socialists for their destruction of the elite who I believed drove society onwards, I do so no longer.\n\n"I cannot speak to the entire nation. But I can speak to my friends and correspondents and community: I hereby endorse Norman Thomas for President of the United States. In his campaign lies the only hope for our great nation, to save us from the reactionary and the Marxist. If the many vile words I have written on the subject of race and class and religion mean anything to you, perhaps then these words will mean something too.""
 
 united_states_flavor.4.desc:0 ""Citizens of the United States!" President Thomas addressed the assembled masses, tens of thousands strong. "We stand here today among the achievements of our forefathers," he swept his arm around to gesture at the White House, the Congress Building, and the Lincoln Memorial, "and this is the day we celebrate their choice, the choice that set America's course towards its god-given destiny of prosperity and greatness, the choice of independence, the choice of revolution!"\n\nThe crowd roared in approval, and Thomas waited patiently for them to fall silent again.\n\n"And today I tell you this: The American revolution isn't over! It was never over! Our revolution is eternal, and our holy father smiles upon us as it progresses. God's grace is with us as we bring liberty and civilization to the world! The Founders, John Brown, Abraham Lincoln, the feminists, all were doing God's divine will and spreading the holy light of freedom further. And our revolution shall continue unabated, so that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the Earth!"\n\nAs Thomas finished the most fiery sermon he'd yet given, the gathered thousands once again roared; thunderous applause spilling over the president as fireworks began to explode in the sky above. Truly, no country could ever be as great as the United States."

 ###united_states_flavor.4.desc:0 "My fellow citizens. We are assembled here today to celebrate the one-hundred and sixtieth anniversary of the birth of our great democracy.\n\nIn 1776 we sought freedom from the tyranny of a political autocracy – from the eighteenth century royalists who held special privileges from the crown. It was to perpetuate their privilege that they governed without the consent of the governed; that they denied the right of free assembly and free speech; that they restricted the worship of God; that they put the average man’s property and the average man’s life in pawn to the mercenaries of dynastic power; that they regimented the people.\n\nAnd so it was to win freedom from the tyranny of political autocracy that the American Revolution was fought. That victory gave the business of governing into the hands of the average man, who won the right with his neighbors to make and order his own destiny through his own Government. Political tyranny was wiped out at Philadelphia on that fateful day of July 4, 1776.\n\nNow, here we stand, one hundred and sixty years later, and man’s inventive genius has released new forces in our land, which reordered the lives of our people. The age of machinery, of railroads; of steam and electricity; the telegraph and the radio; mass production, mass distribution – all of these combined to bring forth a new civilization, and with it a new problem for those who sought to remain free.\n\nI speak, of course, of economic tyranny. For out of this modern civilization, economic royalists carved new dynasties. New kingdoms were built upon concentration of control over material things. Through new uses of corporations, banks and securities, new machinery of industry and agriculture, of labor and capital – all undreamed of by the fathers – the whole structure of modern life was impressed into this royal service.\n\nAgainst tyranny such as this, the American citizen could appeal only to the organized power of Government. The collapse of 1929 showed up the despotism for what it was. The election of 1932 was the people’s mandate to end it. Under that mandate it is being ended."

 ### GENERAL EVENTS THAT WILL ALWAYS HAPPEN ###
 united_states.1.desc:0 "The Winner Take All electoral system of the United States of America has long meant that, in practice, two parties dominate the country's politics, from the local level up to the national level. Once a party has secured the presidency even once, their electoral fortunes are essentially assured for the foreseeable future.\n\nFor the better part of a century, the Democratic and Republican parties used this fact to their advantage. Both were capitalist in flavour; although the specifics varied by date and party, it was known that neither would ever become friendly to socialists in their ranks, making, at best, meaningless concessions to the interests of the working class.\n\nIt was long assumed that the system's strength lay in its rigidity. The simple fact that a party must win the presidency to be taken seriously on the national level would forever protect the Democrats and Republicans from meaningful competition.\n\nWhat they failed to count on was the growing anger of the American people. After the presidency of William McKinley came to an end and Theodore Roosevelt was once again run as a vice-presidential candidate by the Republican National Convention, it was clear to the progressives of the day that the Republicans would sooner die than let one of their own into the White House. Partyless, America's workers and progressive began to defect en-mass from the Republicans and Democrats. They found refuge in a wide variety of third parties but soon began to coalesce around the Socialist Party of America and its charismatic leader, Eugene Debs.\n\nIt wasn't until the 1912 election had come and gone that, in a flash, the leaders of the two foremost parties in the land realized their catastrophic miscalculation. On the fourth of March, 1913, Eugene Debs was sworn in as President of the United States, and the nation and the world were forever changed.\n\nMuch has happened in the USA since then, and the Socialist Party has been out of power but never out of prominence. Norman Thomas, an avowed socialist but fierce anti-communist all the same, now sits as president, preparing to run for his second term. The two-party system has fractured as the socialists drain away support from the big two and run spoiler candidates in races, allowing third parties to worm into local politics. It is unknown what course America shall take, but it must be charted very carefully."
 united_states.7.desc:0 "Bad news for the economy today! Over the past month, unemployment has suddenly jumped up a sizable amount. While still remaining lower than 1932 levels, this does not bode well for the country. Something must be done!"
 united_states.8.desc:0 "Yet more bad news. Across the board, industrial output has fallen as well, now closer to the levels of 1934. We need to act quickly to reverse this, else we risk losing all of the hard-earned gains we have made since 1929."
 united_states.9.desc:0 "Unfortunately, our fears have come to pass: the economy has entered a recession. Thankfully, it has not yet set us back too far, and if we act quickly, we can reverse the losses before the next election cycle!"
 
 ### Thomas ###
 ### Campaign events from intro tree ###
 united_states_thomas.1.desc:0 "Thomas ascended his platform in front of a massive crowd; ten thousand people at least. A deafening roar of approval washed over him as he stepped into sight of the crowd. Taking a moment to shake hands with fellow Socialist Party member and mayor of the city, Fiorello La Guardia, he then stepped forward in front of the microphones.\n\n"Working men and women of New York city and state, it is an honor to stand before you today!"\n\nAnother wave of applause and cheers washed over him.\n\n"I stand today amidst a red metropolis! New York City, under the leadership of La Guardia and with the aid of its countless socialist inhabitants, has excised corruption from the city council, has cast down the petty oligarchs of Tammany Hall, has dragged vile gangsters to prison, and has built vast public works that are the envy of even such cities as London, Paris, and Berlin! New York is a shining beacon to the nation and the world; a beacon of socialist promises made and fulfilled to their greatest extent! New York is the city of the future!"\n\nHe paused as the applause once again grew deafening. This was mostly theater; New York City itself was a clinch for the Socialist Party, and had been since the twenties. There wasn’t much proper campaigning to be done here. Still, it felt quite good to stand before tens of thousands of people and make a little victory lap. Smiling to himself, he continued his speech."
 united_states_thomas.2.desc:0 "President Thomas walked up on stage. He looked over the crowd and hesitated. It seemed to be one of the largest crowds he had ever spoken to, easily numbering in the thousands. He began to sweat. He had always been an author first, not a public speaker. Still, these were mostly striking workers and SPA voters. It should go smoothly, he thought.\n\n"Good afternoon, Flint, Michigan!" Thomas said cheerfully into the microphone. The crowd roared. "I hear you boys have done a mighty fine job of organizing. Been on strike for 3 weeks? Good on you, men. Good on you." He chuckled slightly. "I read an interview in the paper last week with Alfred Sloan, the big boss here at GM." He gave the crowd time to jeer at his name. "He seemed awfully nervous about the strike. I think you all have got him on the run!" The crowd cheered and hollered more, waving their signs.\n\nOn them were written all sorts of slogans, quotes from Marx, and insults at Mr. Sloan and local management. There were large banners colored black and red with SPA and IWW symbols emblazoned on them. As President Thomas looked over the cheering crowd, full of workers with both their fists and voices raised, he was proud. This is what he wanted America to look like. Thousands of working people, united in their knowledge of their own interests and needs. As he drifted off into thought, he realized that he had been silent for some time and the cheering was dying down.\n\n"You know, Alfred Sloan mentioned me in that interview with the Times," Thomas said, forming a sly smile. "He said, 'all this anarchist worker agitation is the fault of these socialists in office.'" The crowd began to boo. "Now wait, folks," the President spoke over them. "He gave me the best compliment I’ve received in all my time in office. He said, 'Because of the labor laws put forward by that communist Norman Thomas, my hands are tied and I can’t do anything to stop this strike.'" The President laughed. "And if that isn’t a reason to be proud of what we in the SPA have achieved, nothing is!"\n\nThe crowd went wild, cheering so loudly that Thomas almost felt pushed back by their sheer volume, and as he looked over the faces of all the uncountable number of striking workers, he knew that Alfred Sloan was right to be afraid, because these workers were the finest that American labor had to offer. As he looked on with pride, a chant was picked up in the crowd, and Thomas wiped a joyful tear from his eye."
 united_states_thomas.3.desc:0 "The President looked across the camp. The people watching him were thin as twigs and seemed to lack all spirit. The way Labor Secretary Perkins explained it to him did not show the reality of the situation at all. She said that in California there was a surplus of migrant workers and a shortage of jobs, so wages were low and conditions were bad. Her briefing did not prepare Thomas to see the absolute destitution and misery that this migrant work camp displayed. Dozens of eyes were upon him as he stood in front of a small crowd.\n\n"So, where are you all from?" Thomas asked, forcing an awkward smile.\n\n"We’re from Oklahoma," said one woman in the crowd. "We came here for work, and there ain’t none."\n\nThomas was taken aback by the bluntness of her words. No one had spoken to him like that before. "Well, there’s a government camp just a few miles north of here that’s a part of the Recovery Acts. They can give you work and see to your needs if you wish."\n\n"That’s where I came from!" yelled a man from the back of the crowd. "They ain’t got the money to pay us or food to feed us! It looks just like here, except the coppers harass ya when you try to get in!"\n\nThomas looked on in shock. "The police are opposing the Recovery?" he asked incredulously. A few people in the crowd laughed at his disbelief.\n\n"‘Course they are," said a teenage boy. "All the coppers ‘round here are crooked. The planters pay ‘em more than the state does. All they do is harass us, and wave guns at anyone who tries to organize."\n\n"Just two days back, they shot my brother for strikin’!" a young girl cried. "Killed him dead!"\n\nThomas looked to one of his aides. "It’s much worse here than I thought. We should go." He gave a brief farewell to the crowd and turned to walk away. As he did, however, a woman pushed his way past his bodyguards and grabbed him by the arm.\n\n"Mister President, sir," she pleaded to him. "It’s so much worse here than it looks. I’ve fed grown men here with my own breast milk because they’d starve to death otherwise. We want a recovery, sir, so, so badly, but we ain’t getting one here." She let go of his arm as tears began to flow from her eyes. Norman opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. After a few moments, she turned and walked back to the crowd."
 united_states_thomas.4.desc:0 ""
 united_states_thomas.5.desc:0 "President Thomas stood on a podium before a large crowd of working men on an unused dock, where his platform had been set up. There were at least four hundred people in attendance, a fair number. He’d speak to thousands before his time in Chicago was finished.\n\nThe city’s main industries were meat packing and metalworking, and his speech had been planned accordingly. What hadn’t been planned for was the fact that a significant minority of the people who appeared at his rallies in the city were African American.\n\nUpon asking, he’d been informed by a black campaign aid that this was because of something called the “Great Northward Migration”. Its causes were varied but predictable; racial violence and lack of economic opportunity in the South were driving African Americans norward to seek employment in Northern cities, like Chicago. With this in mind, he’d adjusted his speeches accordingly.\n\n"Working men of Chicago!" He began, addressing the crowd with a warm smile. "We stand in a city built by your toil. A city of towering buildings, massive factories, and sprawling stockyards; all great monuments to progress. But they are more than that. They are monuments to labor; your labor! For too long, rich men in those tall buildings have decided your fate for you. They have taken the fruits of your labor and used them as they saw fit! They have built libraries and opera houses and theaters and hotels. But what good are libraries when your children cannot read? What good is opera and theater when your meager pay cannot buy you a ticket? What good are hotels when you don’t have the time for vacation?"\n\nFrom among the crowd came grumbled agreement; heads nodding, eyes locked on Thomas as he gave voice to their frustrations.\n\n"Comrades, the Socialist Party of America hears you! If we are given your mandate, we shall ensure that no longer will your hard labor go towards luxuries that you yourself are denied! Your children will have schools, your family will have the money for entertainment and cultural edification, and you will have generous time away from work to spend at your leisure! The Republicans and Democrats have had decades to fulfill these same promises, and they have lied time and time again. The Socialists are a worker’s party, your fate is ours! We will never forget you, and never abandon you!"\n\nThere as a generous round of applause, and hollers of support arose from the assembly.\n\nSwallowing nervously, Thomas began the second part of his speech, careful not to let the nervousness make his voice waver. "I see assembled before me today members from both races of America, black and white. No matter where we hail from, we are all Americans, drawn here by God-given opportunity. At time like this, where the segregationists seek to divide the working class along artificial lines and make it tear itself apart so that a few tycoons and tyrants might profit, we must remember that we are all in this fight together, regardless of race or creed! God bless America, and God bless the working class!"\n\nThe applause was louder now, supplemented by cheering, although Thomas suspected that it was more from his invocation of god than his preaching about racial equality. Either way, it made him smile."
 united_states_thomas.6.desc:0 "President Thomas wiped the sweat off the top of his head. His underarms were also stained with it, as he baked in the Louisiana sun. It didn’t seem to be phasing Senator Huey Long at all though, who was still giving a lively diatribe. "I know President Thomas wants to help the common people, he really does, and I admire that. But how much has his red Recovery really done for them? Something, sure, but not enough! Certainly nowhere near as much as my Share Our Wealth plan would!" The crowd murmured in agreement.\n\nThomas cut in. "I like your Share Our Wealth program, I really do! I wish my Recovery plan could look more like it," he said. The crowd looked with curiosity. "In fact, maybe it could, if Huey Long and his fellow AFP members would support it so that we didn’t have to compromise with the Republicans and Democrats for votes!" The crowd had been captured. Thomas had always been a more talented author than public speaker, but he had a chance here. He could make them cheer. He turned to Long. "But how is it that you think you can collectivize the capital of a society without collectivizing the means by which that capital is produced?" The crowd was silent. Titled heads and raised eyebrows were all that met his gaze. He lost it.\n\nLong pounced. "Now what in blazes is that supposed to mean? You’re talkin’ about socialism? Now there’s a good reason we don’t do socialism." Long smiled and spoke more loudly to the crowd. "Cause socialism destroys nations! We’ve seen what socialism did to Russia, and it’s a good thing that America remains a democracy or they’d do the same thing here! Our opposition is the only thing saving America from a red terror!" The crowd roared and cheered.\n\nLong softened his tone. "Capitalism isn’t just an economic system, folks. It’s a God-given mandate for the American people that dates all the way back to the Israelites and the Ten Commandments. 'Thou shalt not covet.' These reds, folks, they covet everything. Under socialism, you wouldn’t even get to own your own garters." The crowd nodded in agreement. President Thomas knew he couldn’t compete with Long’s oratories ability, even though Long was talking nonsense. He tried to draw on his religious education as he moved into a half-hearted and poorly received rebuttal."
 
 ### Work events from intro tree ###
 united_states_thomas.7.desc:0 ""When we lose the next war, and an American boy, lying in the mud with an enemy bayonet through his belly and an enemy foot on his dying throat, spits out his last curse, I want the name not to be MacArthur, but Thomas!" MacArthur screamed. The news that the Army's budget was to be cut by 51% was just too much.\n\n"You must not talk that way to the President!" Thomas yelled back. He could tolerate criticism, but MacArthur had gone too far this time.\n\n"I don't give a damn! If you will not reconsider this stupidity, then I offer to resign! I will not be responsible!"\n\n"So be it then! I accept your resignation!"\n\nMacArthur froze. He could feel a rumbling in his stomach. He quickly made an about-face and stepped out of the office, the argument clearly over. His head was swimming. He needed air. He'd barely staggered out of the front door when it hit. He doubled over, and promptly vomited on the front steps of the White House."
 
 ### SECOND TERM THOMAS EVENTS ###
 united_states_thomas.9.desc:0 "President Thomas stared down at the sheet of paper on his desk, looking over the names that had been drawn up for potential cabinet appointments.\n\nThe election results had been good, but not perfect, and had planted a seed of doubt in the president’s mind. If the Socialist Party was truly to become America’s leading party then it would need popular support. More so, at least, than it currently had.\n\nThomas stared down at the list and smiled. It was a grand who’s who of socialist mainstays, from W.E.B. Du Bois to Emma Goldman.\n\nIt was a radical list, to be sure. A more radical government had never been assembled since Lincoln’s day. But these were radical times, and it wouldn’t do to stick with stodgy liberal-capitalist political thinking. That was a dying breed, and Thomas had no wish to resuscitate it.\n\nThe cabinet he was putting together would be unconventional, and Goldman’s inclusion would definitely raise some eyebrows, but it would show the people that, without a doubt, the Socialist Party was committed to socialism and the liberation of all men and women.\n\nThat was the only real way to gain popular support, Thomas decided, leaning back in his chair with a smile on his face. Appeal to the people directly, and show them that the Socialist Party had their interests at heart first and foremost, not the pleadings and mutterings of the capitalist parties."
 united_states_thomas.10.desc:0 ""It’s a racket. That’s the long and the short of it." Major General Smedley Butler said plainly, addressing President Thomas. "It’s part of a scheme the tycoons cooked up to get you out of power. The first step was causing the economy to crash again, on purpose this time. Then they came forward to me, and asked me to lead a coup against you. They think I’m popular, and they came to me because I led capitalist interventions in Latin America to prop up business interests there. They thought I’d be willing to do the same here; to get me to lead an army of veterans, organized through the American Legion, into Washington, coup the government, and install a fascist dictatorship."\n\n"And, since you’re sitting here telling me this, would I be correct in assuming that you’re not?"\n\n"You would be correct, sir."\n\nThere was a long moment of silence. President Thomas rubbed his temples, sighing. "Thank you for telling me, General Butler. I’m very grateful for your faith in my administration. I understand that you have some reservations about our more radical policies, but your loyalty to the Constitution in spite of us is outstanding."\n\nButler merely nodded.\n\n"Who do you know for sure was in on the conspiracy?"\n\n"Henry Ford, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, Gerald C. MacGuire, Bill Doyle, Grayson Murphy, and Robert Sterling Clark. They’re the ones I met in person. They mentioned others, I have a full list in a notebook."\n\n"I’ll inform the FBI and have a House committee look into the matter." Seeing Butler open his mouth, Thomas cut him off. "I know, I know. They might be compromised; capitalist influence is still strong, especially in the FBI, but it’s our only course of action that won’t cause a constitutional crisis.""
 united_states_thomas.11.desc:0 ""They say they can’t find any solid evidence." Thomas shrugged, looking across the Resolute Desk at General Butler. "I don’t believe them, of course. From what I can see from here, they did the bare minimum they could get away with and then declared the case closed."\n\nButler sighed, leaning back in his chair. "It was perhaps foolish of me to think that we could catch the racketeers in the act. They cover their tracks too well."\n\n"The FBI noted that they couldn’t confirm the locations of the people you mentioned at the time you said that you were meeting with them, but people hardly leave their schedules lying around anyway, and 'not being where we think you ought to be' isn’t a crime nor is it particularly compelling evidence of a crime, so my hands are tied here, Smedley. The best we can do is stay vigilant. I’m shuffling the military administration to ensure that there are loyal men in key strategic positions, should the worst happen, but otherwise we are without recourse at the moment."\n\nThe general nodded. "You can count on my loyalty in such a situation, Mr. President, as much as I pray it won’t come to pass." His commander-in-chief dismissed him, and the general stood to gather his coat. Looking over his shoulder, he said. "And I’m sorry about the negative press all this has brought on you. You’ve probably seen the New York Times, calling us and the congressional committee a gang of witch-hunters."\n\nThomas sighed. "It’s nothing new, I assure you. The capitalist press has never been friendly to socialists. We’ll weather the storm like all that have come before it, and come out stronger than before."\n\n"Indeed. Good day, Mr. President.""
 united_states_thomas.20.desc:0 "President Thomas looked over the assembled papers. Piles upon piles of documents, graphs, charts, and folders. "Alright... what is all this?" He looked up to vice president Reed.\n\n"Bureaucracy, Mr. President." Jack pushed a set of papers to the front of the desk for Thomas to see. "We have a National Economic Recovery Council, Federal Aid Commission, National Financial Aid Board, Federal Recovery Commission, and Federal People's Recovery Commission, among many, many more. Frankly, there are too many agencies, some of which are entirely redundant. We're 'wasting' money, according to the conservatives. Personally I don't see too much of an issue; we're providing jobs to people who otherwise might be unemployed, but governmental 'bloat' is easy to turn into a campaign issue, so this could be a liability."\n\nSometimes it paid to have a journalist as the vice.\n\n"Alright, so, you're suggesting we consolidate them?"\n\n"Yes, Mr. President. And quick, before campaign season ramps up and it looks like we're covering our ass.""
 
 united_states_thomas.23.desc:0 ""You're retiring?" Thomas's eyes looked the other man up and down, silently appraising his vice president, and lingering on the dark circles under the man's eyes. Jack had been a friend, and, more than that, an ally, for years. He helped keep the peace with the more radical members of the party, keeping everyone on the same team.\n\n"Yeah." Reed coughed. "I don't want to go, of course, but I don't feel like I have much choice. Damn typhus. It spent too long in me in Russia, and now no doctor in this whole damned country can get it out of me." The circles under his eyes seemed to grow darker as he slumped back into his chair. "I'm so sorry, Norman. I have to do this. I can't keep this up anymore. I'm too old for this."\n\nThe vice president stared down at the floor, and Norman could swear he saw tears glistening in his eyes. "We're the old guard, Norman. We're the only ones who remember the good old days, back when Eugene and Bill were still here." It was an exaggeration, but not much of one. A lot of the newer party members had been sucking their thumbs when Debs was president.\n\nPresident Thomas sighed, his own eyes directed down at his desk. He suddenly felt empty and cold; old.\n\n"I'll be with you until the end of this term. We'll have to have a primary in the party to find my successor."\n\nThomas nodded.\n\n"... Tom. Promise me you'll finish the job. No half-measures, like Labour did in Britain. We can't sell out now; we're so close to the end. We can break capital's back if we win the next election. We just need one more push. Promise me you won't sell out."\n\nReed had always been more radical than Thomas. Their friendship had gotten off to a rocky start when Thomas had been informed of Reed's adventure in Russia and subsequent flirtation with Leninism, to say nothing of his unabashed Marxism. He said nothing; merely stared down at his desk and nodded."
