 ITA_spreading_commies:0 "After this focus is completed, the countries of §YRomania, Serbia, Albania, Greece, and Bulgaria§! will get events to join your faction, only if the popularity of §RRevolutionary Autocracy§! in said countries is above §Y50%§!."

 ITA_begin_the_revisions:0 "Begin the Revisions"
 ITA_begin_the_revisions_desc:0 "Italy is weak. The Duce’s reforms have made it stronger than it was before, but the nation is still behind where it must be to become a true world power. This failure must be caused by disloyal and anti-fascist elements in our government and society that must be rooted out and destroyed so that we can truly enact the Duce’s infallible vision for a strong, united, and fascist Italy. Now, the bitter work of cleansing this country must begin."
 ITA_purge_grand_council:0 "Purge the Grand Council"
 ITA_purge_grand_council_desc:0 "The Grand Council of Fascism, once a party organ of the PNF, is now the most powerful state institution outside of the Duce’s office. Once, a naive Mussolini felt that a diversity of opinions, from national-syndicalists to moderate conservatives, could strengthen Italy. Now he must correct that mistake. For the Duce’s vision of Italy to prevail, we must purge all members of the Grand Council that do not share his exact goals. The party must fall in line and be united in cause if Italy is to do the same."
 ITA_purge_the_unloyal_blackshirts:0 "Purge the Disloyal Blackshirts"
 ITA_purge_the_unloyal_blackshirts_desc:0 "The Blackshirts, the paramilitary wing of the PNF, were instrumental in the Duce’s rise to power. However, even here, at the heart of fascist militarism, rot has begun to grow. The Blackshirts are the key to power in Italy, and they must stand behind the Duce without question or hesitation. We will purge anyone who even glances at disloyalty, so that the Blackshirts can be truly trusted, no matter what."
 ITA_the_one_man_dictator:0 "The One Man Dictator"
 ITA_the_one_man_dictator_desc:0 "We have secured Mussolini’s power from all internal threats, and he now has all party members at his every beck and call, lest they be added to the Blackshirts’ lists. The Duce is Italy, and Italy is the Partito Nazionale Fascista. Now that all of Italy is under full control of the Duce, we can move towards our glorious future unimpeded by traitors and fifth columns."
 ITA_begin_to_refill_lost_ranks:0 "Begin to Refill Lost Ranks"
 ITA_begin_to_refill_lost_ranks_desc:0 "The purges were necessary for the future of Italy, and those who were purged were traitors deserving of worse than what they got. However, that does not mean that there were no negative consequences. Many positions in our government remain vacant, and we must find new, loyal fascists to fill them if we are to be a functional state moving forward. A propaganda campaign and a pay raise should encourage people to overlook the occupational hazards."

 ITA_begin_to_expand_italys_influence_desc:0 "Italy may not have the strongest industry or military in the world yet, but it has the strongest political system, fascism, let by the strongest leader, Benito Mussolini. It is time to begin spreading the Italian Eagle’s wings across the Mediterranian and beyond. The true language of power is war, but some may align with us peacefully after they see the glorious things we have accomplished with fascism."
