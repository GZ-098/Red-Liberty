 ITA_leftists_in_the_blackshirts:0 "Leftists in the Blackshirts?"
 ITA_leftists_in_the_grand_council_of_fascism:0 "Leftists in the Council?"
 
 ITA_spreading_commies:0 "After this focus is completed, the countries of §YRomania, Serbia, Albania, Greece, and Bulgaria§! will get events to join your faction, only if the popularity of §RRevolutionary Autocracy§! in said countries is above §Y50%§!."

 ITA_begin_the_revisions:0 "Begin the Revisions"
 ITA_begin_the_revisions_desc:0 "Italy is weak. The Duce’s reforms have made it stronger than it was before, but the nation is still behind where it must be to become a true world power. This failure must be caused by disloyal and anti-fascist elements in our government and society that must be rooted out and destroyed so that we can truly enact the Duce’s infallible vision for a strong, united, and fascist Italy. Now, the bitter work of cleansing this country must begin."
 ITA_purge_grand_council:0 "Purge the Grand Council"
 ITA_purge_grand_council_desc:0 "The Grand Council of Fascism, once a party organ of the PNF, is now the most powerful state institution outside of the Duce’s office. Once, a naive Mussolini felt that a diversity of opinions, from national-syndicalists to moderate conservatives, could strengthen Italy. Now he must correct that mistake. For the Duce’s vision of Italy to prevail, we must purge all members of the Grand Council that do not share his exact goals. The party must fall in line and be united in cause if Italy is to do the same."
 ITA_purge_the_unloyal_blackshirts:0 "Purge the Disloyal Blackshirts"
 ITA_purge_the_unloyal_blackshirts_desc:0 "The Blackshirts, the paramilitary wing of the PNF, were instrumental in the Duce’s rise to power. However, even here, at the heart of fascist militarism, rot has begun to grow. The Blackshirts are the key to power in Italy, and they must stand behind the Duce without question or hesitation. We will purge anyone who even glances at disloyalty, so that the Blackshirts can be truly trusted, no matter what."
 ITA_the_one_man_dictator:0 "The One Man Dictator"
 ITA_the_one_man_dictator_desc:0 "We have secured Mussolini’s power from all internal threats, and he now has all party members at his every beck and call, lest they be added to the Blackshirts’ lists. The Duce is Italy, and Italy is the Partito Nazionale Fascista. Now that all of Italy is under full control of the Duce, we can move towards our glorious future unimpeded by traitors and fifth columns."
 ITA_begin_to_refill_lost_ranks:0 "Begin to Refill Lost Ranks"
 ITA_begin_to_refill_lost_ranks_desc:0 "Since our purge of the party we’ve lost thousands of individuals to either death, prison, or exile. Many of the questionable members of our party were also the most intelligent and competent, but that’s probably just a coincidence. In any case, we now find ourselves needing to bolster our ranks with new recruits and bureaucrats."
 ITA_refill_grand_council_seats:0 "Refill the Seats of the Grand Council of Fascism" 
 ITA_refill_grand_council_seats_desc:0 "The Grand Council of Fascism is our nation’s most prestigious government body, holding immense sway over the workings of our fascist system. It was only to be expected that infiltrators would try and work their way into it like worms eating to an apple’s core. Now that we have disposed of those infiltrators, it’s time to refill their positions with people we can trust."
 ITA_expand_our_african_holdings:0 "Expand Our African Holdings!"
 ITA_expand_our_african_holdings_desc:0 "The time is now! Ethiopia is weak and vulnerable, and there is no one to stop us on the international stage! It is time to strike while the iron is hot and take back what was kept from us in 1896! This time there will be no stopping until the red, white, and green flies over Addis Ababa!  "
 ITA_expand_the_number_of_seats:0 "A Council of Yes-Men"
 ITA_expand_the_number_of_seats_desc:0 "Now that the Grand Council is firmly stacked in our favor, none of the members will dare oppose our Duce’s vision for a glorious fascist future. Whenever they are asked to do something, their immediate and only answer shall be “Si!”"
 ITA_hire_new_blackshirts:0 "Hire New Blackshirts"
 ITA_hire_new_blackshirts_desc:0 "Our paramilitary organization, the Blackshirts, were among the most heavily hit by the purge. Perhaps it was because the tactics we used for meting out who was loyal and who wasn’t were rather unsavory, and the Blackshirts are especially skilled at using unsavory tactics. We must bolster our ranks immediately, lest we give rival socialist and liberal militias a chance to regroup and strike back at us in our moment of weakness."
 ITA_force_new_laws_through:0 "Force New Laws Through"
 ITA_force_new_laws_through_desc:0 "With our opponents in the government cowed into silence, now is an excellent time to force through new laws which will bring our glorious nation closer to Il Duce’s fascist vision. They will surely meet with minimal resistance after the show of force that we have just made."
 ITA_the_italian_ranks_are_full:0 "The Italian Ranks are Full"
 ITA_the_italian_ranks_are_full_desc:0 "We are victorious! The Battle for the Body Politic has concluded and Il Duce has declared it to be a stunning success! Our nation and the rule of the National Fascist Party is secure for the foreseeable future! Eia, eia, eia! Alalà!"
 ITA_train_the_new_blackshirts:0 "Train the New Blackshirts"
 ITA_train_the_new_blackshirts_desc:0 "Now that we have recruited new members into our ranks, we must train them accordingly. Discipline, brutality, and above all, loyalty to Il Duce are essential qualities for any fascist man!"
 ITA_begin_to_expand_italys_influence:0 "Begin to Expand Italy's Influence"
 ITA_begin_to_expand_italys_influence_desc:0 "Italy may not have the strongest industry or military in the world yet, but it has the strongest political system, fascism, let by the strongest leader, Benito Mussolini. It is time to begin spreading the Italian Eagle’s wings across the Mediterranian and beyond. The true language of power is war, but some may align with us peacefully after they see the glorious things we have accomplished with fascism."
 ITA_claim_austrian_land:0 "Claim Austrian Land" 
 ITA_claim_austrian_land_desc:0 "Istria and Dalmatia have long been rightful Italian land; possessed by the Roman Empire and by the Byzantines after them, and containing a sizable Italian minority to this day. That they are still in the hands of the weak, degenerate Austrians and brutish Hungarians is proof both of the weakness of pre-fascist Italian governments and the spinelessness of their French and British “allies”. We may not be able to act immediately, but we will claim our rightful lands without delay."
 ITA_expand_italys_scope:0 "Expand Italy's Scope"
 ITA_expand_italys_scope_desc:0 "Now that our internal affairs are in order and we have made our territorial claims, it is at last time to act on them. Our soldiers stand ready to march forth and reclaim Italian greatness, and our Blackshirts are massed to follow in their wake, putting down all resistance to our rule. Forward!"

 ITA_lay_claim_to_french_lands:0 "Lay Claim to French Lands"
 ITA_lay_claim_to_french_lands_desc:0 "In a just world, we would be in possession of all of Gaul. But this is not a just world we find ourselves in, and so we must make compromises. The French will never accept it, but the least we can to is lay claim to what we think is a reasonable amount of their territory: Everything on our side of the Rhone River."

 ITA_lay_claims_to_french_lands:0 "Lay Claims to French Land"
 ITA_claim_lands_in_africa:0 "Lay Claims to French and British African Holdings"
 ITA_claim_lands_in_africa_desc:0 "Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt: This is our Fourth Shore, as Il Duce calls it; possessions of the ancient Romans and, by birthright, our rightful domain. That the French and British currently lay claim to these places is of no consequence to us. They will be swept aside by the crashing waves of history."
 ITA_begin_border_skirmishes_on_the_ethiopian_border:0 "Begin Border Skirmishes on the Ethiopian Border"
 ITA_begin_border_skirmishes_on_the_ethiopian_border_desc:0 "Ever since the humiliation of 1896, Italy has had her eyes set upon Ethiopia. The time for vengeance and justice is imminent! The Entente is distracted; now is the time to act! We must begin testing Ethiopian resistance along our shared border and look for weaknesses."
 ITA_expand_african_influence:0 "Claim Lands for a Greater Italy"
 ITA_expand_african_influence_desc:0 "Once, Italians were the masters of an empire that stretched from Rome to the far shores of the Mediterranean, from the forests of Germany to the deserts of Africa and Arabia. As the heirs of Rome, we must establish claims on our rightful territory and begin the reclamation of our empire!"
 ITA_italianize_the_ethiopians:0 "Italianize the Ethiopians"
 ITA_italianize_the_ethiopians_desc:0 "With our victory now cemented and our mastery of Ethiopia assured, we can now move on to ensuring that our empire takes root in this savage land. We will spare no expense to Italianize the Ethiopians; forcing them to use our language and worship in the proper Catholic way. And if any cultural or political figures dare oppose us, well, no one will miss them."
 ITA_the_roman_vision_speech:0 "The Roman Vision Speech" 
 ITA_the_roman_vision_speech_desc:0 "With our ambitions now set forth for ourselves and all the world to behold, it is time to make them part of official fascist doctrine. Our Duce is preparing to deliver a speech to announce to Italy his intentions of rebuilding the Roman Empire for them and their posterity. We shall prove ourselves to be glorious, as our forefathers did, for naught but blood can turn the wheels of history!"

 ITA_give_orders_to_the_blackshirts_desc:0 "Now that our ranks are flush with new members and they’ve been thoroughly indoctrinated, it’s time to give out marching orders. We’ve identified several safehouses that are being used by anti-fascist groups as hideouts in between their vicious attack on our government, such as handing out leaflets that call for our removal. It’s time to crush these insurrectionists before they grow into something even worse."
