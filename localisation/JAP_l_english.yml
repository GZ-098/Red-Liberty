 POLITICS_KATO_SHIDZUE_DESC:0 "A dark horse within the Nihon Ronoto, Kato is one of the most influential and powerful women in the world. The youngest and first ever female Prime Minister to take office, Kato was chosen due to her remarkably high popularity among women, who now have the ability to vote. It was this very ability which has given the Ronoto their victory, and Kato, a feminist inspired by the American Margaret Sanger, has leveraged this fact to assemble a cabinet of socialists and feminists, including several women, to enact her radically progressive plans. If she succeeds, the Ronoto may forever be the party of the Japanese woman."
 POLITICS_SAITO_TAKAO_DESC:0 "Saito Takao, one of the most prominent progressives in modern Japan, has been a rising star in the Minseito party for years. A staunch enemy of nationalist militarist Konoe, and occasional liaison with the leftist Ronoto party, it came as little surprise that Saito and his allies pushed for forming a coalition with the socialists after the 1936 elections. Although not a socialist himself, Saito is more than willing to work with them for social reform and opposition to militarism. Now that he himself is Prime Minister, with or without Ronoto allies, it is his turn to leave his mark on Japan."
 konoe_fumimaro_desc:0 "Fumimaro Konoe is one of the most powerful aristocrats in Japan, and the head of the Tohokai faction, an unofficial political bloc representing the military, aristocracy, and nationalists. Disillusioned with the Western concept of liberal democracy after the Great War, and horrified by the progressive, leftist, and populist vision gaining popularity in Japan, Konoe developed a vision of an authoritarian, nationalist state headed by the military and the Emperor. After the incredibly dangerous formation of the Minseito-Ronoto coalition that threatened to destroy Japan, Konoe rapidly organized the Tohokai and military into bringing down the government and putting himself into power. Now, Konoe’s radical vision is a national reality."
 showa_desc:0 "The Emperor of Japan and one of the most powerful men in the world, His Imperial Majesty is one of the supreme motivating forces in Japanese politics. Although not directly involved with most political affairs, his endorsement is needed for the survival of any government. With the dismissal of the last Diet and the next one still being elected, Showa is effectively the head of state."
 POLITICS_INUKAI_TSUYOSHI_DESC:0 "Inukai Tsuyoshi is very old; the oldest person to hold the office of Prime Minister by no small margin. This grants him much respect in Japanese culture and politics, but has also led to serious concerns about his health. Born into a samurai family and making his first impression as a reporter, Inukai has been involved in politics for more than fifty years. A staunch moderate and civic conservative operating a compromise cabinet of both Seiyukai and Minseito members, Inukai has maintained the stability (and civility) of Japanese politics for years through compromise and cooperation, despite pressure from the military and a growing leftist movement. Now in his eighties and rarely making public appearances, many wonder what whether Inukai will die or resign, and what will happen next."
 
 JAP_inukai_govt:0 "The Inukai Government"
 JAP_inukai_govt_desc:0 "Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi’s government has brought prosperity to Japan, holding both the military and the growing tide of leftism in check and maintaining competent, respectable governance for years. The longevity and stability of the Inukai government has, according to some, saved Japanese democracy. However, Inukai is very old, and the fate of his government is in question, as is the fate of Japan afterwards."
 JAP_sino_japanese_friendship:0 "Sino-Japanese Friendship"
 JAP_sino_japanese_friendship_desc:0 "In 1915, the Japanese government provided 21 Demands to the Republic of China, gaining exclusive trading rights and ending the Open Door Policy of Western imperialism. President Yuan Shikai agreed in exchange for a secret demand of his own... When he declared himself the Hongxian Emperor, we backed him, and we still back his successor, Emperor Rongyao. Sino-Japanese relations have never been better, and we are both reaping the rewards!"
 JAP_bipartisanship:0 "Bipartisanship"
 JAP_bipartisanship_desc:0 "Inukai’s government, despite being mostly dominated by the Seiyukai, is actually a coalition government between the Seiyukai, Minseito, and other smaller moderate parties. The Seiyukai are the eldest of these siblings, but we cannot alienate our little brothers, either. Thankfully, Prime Minister Inukai is a master of compromise. Our bipartisan coalition is more than secure."
 JAP_sideline_extremists:0 "Sideline Extremists"
 JAP_sideline_extremists_desc:0 "One of the reasons Inukai has been able to remain Prime Minister for so long is that many in government and much of the population are afraid of the extremists that might jump at the slightest instability. On the right, Konoe and his militarist clique want a deeply undemocratic nationalist society. On the left, people like Kato are advocating radical ideas like communism and feminism. Most are opposed to both of these groups, and we must ensure it stays that way."
 JAP_socio_economic_stability:0 "Socio-Economic Stability"
 JAP_socio_economic_stability_desc:0 "Inukai’s government is extremely popular, and for good reason! Japan has never done better. Radicals have been kept at bay. Slow, steady progress has been promoted. The economy is doing well despite the rest of the world’s troubles. Japan is a wonderful place to live, so immigration is up too! Cultural optimism is the norm, and life is getting better for most people. Inukai’s health is deteriorating, but it is of no doubt that whatever comes next, Inukai will be viewed as a hero for the rest of time."

 JAP_snap_elections_desc:0 "The nation still mourns the loss of Inukai Tsuyoshi, but the government cannot afford to dawdle in these dangerous times. Even as many may reminisce on the past, the Diet is looking to the future. New elections have been called by the interim Prime Minister, and the three main parties are all gearing up for campaigns. The future of Japan is now up for vote."
 JAP_seiyukai_platform:0 "Seiyukai Platform"
 JAP_seiyukai_platform_desc:0 "The Rikken Seiyukai is a conservative party, advocating for traditional values and policies, as well as a moderate level of government control. They have a warm relationship with the military, but aren’t as cozy with the Zaibatsu. Most of their campaigning this election is focused on fear mongering about the far left and riding off the popularity of Inukai. The Seiyukai seem deeply confident in their odds of victory."
 JAP_minseito_platform:0 "Minseito Platform"
 JAP_minseito_platform_desc:0 "The Rikken Minseito is the second largest party, after the Seiyukai. They are a liberal party with a strong relationship with business and the Zaibatsu, and high popularity among the upper and middle classes. They espouse capitalist and free-market values along with progressive social policies. Their campaigning focuses largely on the popular desire for more social reforms and intense pro-market messaging, along with a large amount of private funding."
 JAP_ronoto_platform:0 "Ronoto Platform"
 JAP_ronoto_platform_desc:0 "The Nihon Ronoto is the left-wing party in Japan, and the definite underdog in the elections. While their numbers have been rising year after year, they have no real chance to win this year, but they seek even more growth than ever. Their vigorous campaigning centers around popular dissatisfaction with the military and the Seiyukai, and the desire for a more populist economic program. The red tide may just keep rising."
 JAP_the_results:0 "The Results"
 JAP_the_results_desc:0 "All the major parties’ propaganda is moving into high gear as the elections are underway. Many districts across the country will be hard-fought, as the Seiyukai try to defend their plurality against the rising tide of progressivism. They are confident in victory, but it is entirely possible that the Minseito may dethrone them, and the Ronoto will likely continue their trend of gaining seats every year. As the voting begins and the results trickle in, every Japanese family is huddled around a radio..."
 JAP_status_quo:0 "Status Quo"
 JAP_status_quo_desc:0 "The Minseito have decided to reform the coalition with the Seiyukai, like they did under Inukai’s government. This was a popular decision, as nostalgia for the time before Inukai’s death is still high, and many in the party simply want to keep the good times going. What has been sacrificed, however, is the chance for major, radical reforms, and possibly Saito’s control of the coalition."
 JAP_picking_a_cabinet:0 "Picking a Cabinet"
 JAP_picking_a_cabinet_desc:0 "The process for deciding who will serve on the coalition government is exhausting. Ichiro and his allies have been pushing hard, fighting tooth and nail for every position, and gaining a very disproportionate amount of control over the government despite their loss in the election. With Saito on the defensive and already committed to a coalition, there is little we can do about it. The liberals know what Konoe and the military might do if a government isn’t formed soon..."
 JAP_july_crisis:0 "The July Crisis"
 JAP_july_crisis_desc:0 "The military has revolted! By a quirk of the Meiji Constitution, the Navy and Army Ministers must be active serving admirals or generals, allowing the military to withhold ministers and kill coalitions in the cradle. This is exactly what has happened, as the Imperial Army and Navy, fearing what a progressive Minseito-Ronoto Coalition might do to reduce their influence, have boycotted the government. If something drastic isn’t done, the coalition may collapse..."
 JAP_constitutional_amendment:0 "The Constitutional Amendment"
 JAP_constitutional_amendment_desc:0 "Thankfully, His Majesty the Emperor, in his divine wisdom, has approved a motion for a constitutional amendment, an unprecedented action for Japanese politics. The House of Peers will surely fall in line under him, and so it is time for us, with our majority in the House of Representatives, to put forth the proposal: the Army and Navy Ministers need no longer be active generals or admirals! This will free Japanese democracy from military influence, and ensure that the people’s voices, not the military’s, drives the government."
 JAP_konoe_govt:0 "The Konoe Government"
 JAP_konoe_govt_desc:0 "The worst has come to pass. As the progressive coalition fizzles out and the government enters a period of crisis, His Majesty the Emperor has granted Prince Konoe Fumimaro permission to establish a new government. The public is in outrage and the House of Representatives is furious, but the House of Peers and the Imperial Throne have decided that it is time for the military aristocracy to restore order after the political failures of the left. Japan fearfully awaits the consequences of this nationalist, unstable government."

 JAP_japanese_democracy_desc:0 "Japanese democracy is modeled off of the parliamentary system of Great Britain, but has a tendency to be more unstable. Prime Ministers often come and go quickly, with governments rising and falling in sometimes less than a year (Inukai being an exception). This, combined with widespread corruption and nepotism, makes Japanese politics a fast-paced game of drama and scandal."
 JAP_military_influence:0 "Military Influence"
 JAP_military_influence_desc:0 "The politicization of the military is a serious problem. Despite how unpopular the military and its scheming are with the population, the nature of Japanese politics and a quirk of the Meiji Constitution give them an alarming level of control over domestic politics. Some, such as the Tohokai faction, would use this influence to destroy democracy itself."

Economic concessions, railway leases, extraction rights, and control over concessions on the coast are all benefits of this agreement. In return, we provide support and recognition to the Chinese Empire that Yuan proclaimed later that year."

 japan.2.desc:0 ""Eleven Year Anniversary of 21 Demands: Still Worth It?" reads the title of the article. It had been presented to the Emperor after it caused quite a stir. His eyes pored over the text, taking in the arguments. The article felt reasonable, giving strong arguments both for and against the controversial treaty his father had signed with the Japanese. It stabilized the government, some said, and allowed valuable Japanese investment in the economy. The deal strengthened China, some said.\n\nBut critics pointed out the control Japan had; the concessions they were given. They compared it to the reviled Unequal Treaties. These were controversial arguments, with both sides calling the other traitorous and anti-Chinese. When he finished the article, Rongyao looked up at the secretary who brought to him. "What do you think, your majesty?"\n\n"I think it’s excellent," Rongyao said. "Yang Bin does excellent work here, one of the Empire’s finest journalists. Could you please send her my commendations for the balanced reporting?"\n\n"Yes, your majesty, but...""
 japan.3.desc:0 "Chiyo knocked on the door a final time. Prime Minister Inukai had still not woken up, and a meeting of the Diet was to take place in only an hour. "For Inukai-sama to sleep in is normal," Hideko, another servant, said, "but this is ridiculous!" Chiyo took a deep breath and braced herself for the act of disrespect she, only the head servant, was now forced to commit. She opened the door to Inukai’s room, stepped in, quickly bowed, and spoke. "My humblest apologies, Prime Minister, but it is nearly 10:00 in the morning..." Inukai did not respond in any way, simply lying still on the bed. Chiyo stood, frozen and still bowed, unsure of what to do next. She looked back at the doorway, where Hideko shrugged at her. Chiyo gradually rose, and slowly, near silently, approached the sleeping Prime Minister. She looked back at Hideko with widened eyes."
 japan.4.desc:0 "Thousands were present for the state-sponsored funeral of Inukai Tsuyoshi. His body had already been cremated, but speeches were given and a great procession of soldiers, politicians, aristocrats, and others was held in Tokyo. Even the Emperor himself was in attendance, although not publicly visible. Speeches were held, calling him a hero and the savior of Japanese politics. Although no one mentioned it explicitly, there was also a hanging uncertainty for what his passing would mean for Japanese politics. New elections were likely to be held, but what then?"
 japan.5.desc:0 "Several hundred Diet members slowly trickle out of the building, minds and mouths abuzz with plans for the future. The acting Prime Minister just read a decree from His Imperial Majesty disbanding the Diet. As his last act before he resigned, he called for new elections, a measure which passed unanimously. The Diet members now all plot their re-elections and create plans for the next government. Most of their districts are secure, but some, especially among the Seiyukai, are not. The next few months will see intense campaigning across Japan."
 japan.6.desc:0 "Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was the greatest prime minister in recent history! He saved the economy; families in Europe and America are starving, while our economy booms! He saved us from imperialism; he resisted Western pressure and brought our Asian brothers closer together! And lastly, he saved us from radicalism. Far-left radicals want to dismantle our economy and turn Japan into a Russo-American puppet. They want to defy nature and have women take on men’s responsibilities. The Ronoto fanatics would destroy the kokutai and the Minseito would let them! Proud citizens, the Seiyukai have made Japan great, and you must vote for them so that we may keep it that way."
 japan.7.desc:0 "The world is changing. Japan is doing well, but we must never stop improving! Prime Minister Inukai was a hero and a savior for giving Japan stability in our time of crisis. But the time of crisis is over, and Japan must move with the ever-changing times! The Seiyukai simply won’t let Japan change. The economy is strong, but stagnant. Cooperation with the private sector could make it grow! Our relations with the outside world are good, but a diplomat’s touch could make them stronger. Extremism has been curbed, but a moderate’s government could preserve stability. Whatever the Seiyukai give, the Minseito can give more of! Vote Minseito for a Japanese future."
 japan.8.desc:0 "Japan needs reform. The military is out of control as they murder our politicans. The government cares not for its citizens. The Seiyukai say the economy is booming, but who sees that wealth? Not common workers. Executives, do you not think your workers to be people? Men, do you not think your mothers and wives to deserve rights? Japanese, do you not think your Asian brothers are your equals? Our society is free for executives, democratic for men, and anti-imperialist for Japanese. The Seiyukai and Minseito work for the few, not the many! We must build a society that fights for all people, and only the Ronoto can get us there!"
 japan.9.desc:0 "The outcome of the election is over - in a shock to the conservative establishment who expected the late Prime Minister’s popularity to save them, the Seiyukai have lost seats in the Diet! Most of those seats have gone to the Minseito or the Ronoto, who could form a coalition if the Minseito want to. The Seiyukai, however, fully expect the newly empowered Minseito to return to the fold and form a new moderate government to continue Inukai’s legacy."
 japan.10.desc:0 "On Saito’s desk sat two letters. One from Ichiro, and one from Abe. The letters used vastly different rhetoric and had starkly different tones, but both requested the same thing in the end: "please form a coalition with us." Both letters were compelling. Abe’s letter appealed to a long history of agreement and cooperation between Saito and the Ronoto party, and how the Seiyukai were unlikely to support his beloved social reforms. Ichiro’s letter appealed to Saito’s deep respect for Inukai, his love of Japan, and desire for stable, civil politics. Saito wanted to work with the Ronto and make true, ambitious changes, but he did not miss the implicit threat in Ichiro’s words. The right would view a progressive coalition as a threat to Japan, and may plunge the nation into turmoil. In the end, it was Saito’s turn to write a fateful letter."
 japan.11.desc:0 "Saito sat at his desk, head in hands. "We’re done, Abe-san. This has been a long time coming." The sense of despair in the room was palpable. Weeks had passed and still not a single general nor admiral had agreed to serve as the Army or Navy Minister for the cabinet. This political strike looked as if it would bring down the government.\n\n"This has Konoe-san’s fingerprints all over it," Abe said. "We cannot fall. If we do, Konoe might take our place and institute a reactionary terror that would make Mussolini-shi hang his head in shame."\n\n"What you want us to do?" Saito said with a tinge of annoyance, raising his head to look at Abe. "Our government is done for if we cannot fill these cabinet seats, and the military have made their position on the issue quite clear."\n\n"What if we did not have to pick a general?" Abe asked musingly.\n\n"We do," Saito retorted. "It’s in the constitution."\n\n"Don’t you feel it odd that the constitution gives the military so much power over politics? Almost by accident."\n\n"What are you getting at, Abe-san?"\n\n"Maybe we should change that.""
 japan.12.desc:0 "Your Imperial Majesty,\n\nIn light of the ongoing political crisis, we, representing the House of Representatives in the Imperial Diet, have respectively come to your Imperial Majesty  with a petition for action. As of the current text of the Meiji Constitution of 1889, the cabinet seats of Army and Navy Minister must be filled by an active general or admiral respectively. This provision has enabled the military to exert a concerning degree of influence in domestic politics, with which they can bring down any government. This de facto veto power over the Prime Minister and his cabinet should be reserved only for Your Imperial Majesty, and is undermining our national democracy. The military should not have the capability to overrule the will of the Japanese people, and by doing so now for political reasons, is infringing on the kokutai and Your Imperial Majesty’s political privileges. We therefore humbly and respectfully request for Your Imperial Majesty to issue a proposition to the Diet to remove the requirement for Army and Navy Ministers to be active generals or admirals.\n\nSincerely, the House of Representatives of the Imperial Diet."
 japan.13.desc:0 "Your Imperial Majesty,\n\nIn light of the failure of the government under Prime Minister Saito Takao to properly assemble a cabinet, it appears that the government has failed. A new Prime Minister must be chosen. It is the opinion of us, the House of Peers of the Imperial Diet, that the recent political crisis and general instability calls for a new approach to domestic governance, which is more in line with the needs, rather than the whims, of the masses, and which is more respectful to the kokutai, the military, and Your Imperial Majesty. We therefore humbly and respectfully propose to you that Konoe Fumimaro be considered as a candidate for the Prime Minister.\n\nSincerely, the House of Peers of the Imperial Diet."
 japan.14.desc:0 "Saito raised the glass, smelled it, and, with a skeptical glance towards a grinning Abe and bemused Kato, took a drink. His face immediately contorted, and Abe burst out laughing, while Kato suppressed chuckle. "I am not ever trying American liquor again, Abe-san," Saito coughed out after swallowing his mouthful of whiskey. Abe then turned to Kato. "You want to try it?" Kato laughed and waved her hand. "No thank you." After a moment of silence, she added, "I could never have guessed when I joined the Ronoto ten years ago, that in ten years I would be celebrating across the table from the Prime Minister!" "Well, you certainly earned it!" laughed Abe. "Thanks to your efforts, the Ronoto is almost more popular than the Minseito among women." "And with our help," Saito said "you may finally get them the vote!" Kato smiled warmly at him. "Still," he said, turning to Abe, "you can’t let her take all the credit! If it weren’t for your idea of the Constitutional Amendment, we wouldn’t have had the chance!" Silence cut across the room as Abe slowly looked over to Kato. Her smile had already dissipated. She broke her brief glare at Abe and turned curtly to Saito."
 japan.15.desc:0 "Konoe Fumimaro looked out across the crowd as he accepted his position as Prime Minister. He finished speaking his allegiance to the Emperor, unblinking and annunciated, as he had practiced it a hundred times. The crowd was silent. Konoe gazed blankly at them. He was not hurt by their lack of enthusiasm. Peasants did not need to be enthusiastic. They only needed to be led. His thinking was disrupted by the gunfire salute behind him. Only then did the people begin to applaud. The salute was unusual, as was the presence of so many soldiers. "Unnecessary," Konoe’s advisor had told him. "It will send the wrong message," he said. "It’s just for my safety," he had told him. "A leftist assassin could hide in the crowd." But the truth was, the soldiers and the gunfire would send exactly the right kind of message. The Emperor, in his divine wisdom, had placed Konoe here to restore order. That meant soldiers, gunfire, and fear. Konoe gave a short speech. He stressed that the opposition had failed, that liberalism had failed, and that the path forward was one of Japanese tradition, faith, the Emperor, and the kokutai. Lasting only a few couple minutes, it was so well-rehearsed that Konoe scarcely even thought the words as he said them. Then, he walked off stage calmly, stood still disinterestedly for a few photos, and headed towards the Diet building."
 japan.16.desc:0 "Saito sat at his desk, dejected. He’d just lost yet another political battle over a minor cabinet position. He could already hear the grumblings of the other party members. He heard a soft knock on his office door and looked up slowly, gaze still lingering to the side. "Come in..." "Saito-sama, I have bad news," said the nervous party official. "I know, a Seiyukai member will be Minister of Agriculture. There’s nothing I can do about it." "No, sir. I meant..." The secretary gulped. "T-they just did an internal poll, and… it looks like most of the party wants a new leader." Saito went white in the face, and ran his fingers through his hair. "No, no, no… we can’t afford to do this right now. Do they know what they’re doing?" The official stared back blankly. "They’re playing right into the Seiyukai’s hands, don’t you see! I bet someone was paid off to run that poll!" Saito’s face began to go from white to red as he stood up rapidly from his desk. "Um… yes, sir. Whatever you say," the official said, raising an eyebrow and writing something down on his clipboard. "With my leadership of the party in question and the clock ticking...""

"I am sorry to keep you waiting like this," he said. "In my old age I am often a late-" The visitor laughed.\n\n"It’s fine, father!" Inukai looked back and smiled wide.\n\n"Takeru! My son! What a pleasant surprise. How are you? How was your trip to China? And how are my grandchildren?"\n\n"They have grown so fast, father. Michiko is now old enough to have opinions on Chinese politics, it seems." They both laughed. "We all enjoyed the trip, and I brought back good news for you."\n\n"Please, do share," Inukai said as he gestured Takeru into the main room. "Would you like some water?"\n\n"No thank you, I must return to my duties soon." Takeru declined. "But I met with the Chinese Emperor and his Japanese advisor while I was there and spoke to them about Pan-Asianism. There was also an envoy from Indochina present."\n\n"Oh? Did things go smoothly?"\n\n"Yes," Takeru said, smiling. "It went very well. The Emperor seemed quite receptive, and got along well with the Vietnamese representative. It seems like the beginning of good relations."\n\n"That is wonderful news!" Inukai exclaimed, patting his son on the back.\n\n"Also," Takeru said, taking an envelope out of his jacket. "The envoy instructed me to give this to you. It’s a message from his Emperor, Cuong De. I know you were close, so I did not open it." Inukai took the sealed envelope in his old, shaky hands and opened it, reading its contents. He smiled warmly, folded it back up, and held it to his chest."
 japan_flavor.2.desc:0 ""Saito-sama," the secretary said. "I have the report you asked for on the goings-on of the military. "Saito Takao looked up at the man from his desk, which was covered by a scattered mess of open books and papers. "Thank you. Did you find anything interesting?"\n\n"Only some budget anomalies, sir. Might indicate corruption, but there’s not enough evidence." "Damn," Saito said, shaking his head. He knew if he could get a bombshell to hurl at the military, he could guarantee to appear in the headlines again. "Did you follow up on the donations?" "Yes, sir. You were right about the generals. They all seem to have financial ties to the Prince."\n\n"Not surprising," Saito said, standing up and pacing behind his desk. "That snake has been scheming his rise to power for more than a decade now. Konoe would destroy Japan." The secretary looked on, amazed but not surprised at Saito’s bluntness. He nodded when Saito looked at him. "Thank you for the report. Keep looking at the military, please. I think that’s the key. Bring me anything you find." The secretary bowed and walked out. Saito returned to his seat and looked over the sheet of paper. He was looking for some kind of conspiracy. Everyone knew there was one, but if he could just crack the code, maybe he could finally get Inukai to see what a threat the military was. Abe, Abaye, Iwasa, Tojo, Oka, Sugita… nothing was lining up for him. But it had to be here somewhere. Saito knew a conspiracy when he saw one, and the Japanese right was full of them. He knew that the eyes of the party were upon him, that they all thought there were better things to spend time and resources on. But as he looked at the report longer, he could see some connections fall into place."
 japan_flavor.3.desc:0 "Konoe Fumimaro glared up at his visitor. An empty bottle of sake and a few sticks of low-burning incense adorned the table. The visitor, Hideki Tojo, continued his winding talk. Konoe wasn’t listening. "Tojo-san, it is late into the evening. You have spoken for nearly half an hour and said nothing. What do you want?" Tojo was silent, seemingly taken aback by the blunt harshness of Konoe’s words.\n\n"Konoe-sama, we both want the same thing. We both know Japan is succumbing to western degeneracy and decadence. We must bring back the spirit of Bushido and Japanese culture. This… liberalism. It isn’t working."\n\n"You still haven’t said anything."\n\nTojo straightened up and clenched his jaw. "The military should intervene." Konoe rolled his eyes.\n\n"Finally. You’re suggesting a coup?" Tojo nodded. "Well, that’s an impressively stupid idea. The military is unpopular, and Inukai is loved by the entire country. If we attempted a coup, the people would sooner accept a state without an army than an army with a state." Tojo glared at Konoe indignantly. "Konoe-sama, I thought you wanted a true Japanese empire, but you’re willing to bow to the will of the people? The people be damned!" he said, slamming his hand on the table. "The Kokutai must be defended!" "I agree," said Konoe flatly. "But political reality is what it is. If you are really willing to risk a trial for treason in suggesting a coup now, you are a fool, Hideki." Konoe stared coldly into Tojo’s eyes.\n\n"You, Hideki, are a military man, and there is a reason the military pays me to do your politics for you. We will strike not when democracy is strong, but when it is weak, and we will not strike with bullets, but with fear. And we will win, because liberals cannot fight fear. Only we, who have strong Bushido spirit can. You wrote that yourself.""
 japan_flavor.4.desc:0 "Ichiro Hatoyama sat at his desk. It was late, and he had meant to go home an hour ago. However, the work had a tendency to give way to more work, and Ichiro was loath to stop when he was in the middle of something. Only when the rabbit-hole of work had finally ended, and everyone else at the party headquarters had gone home, would Ichiro finally retire for the day. Paper after paper was read, signed, categorized, filled out, or written. As the sun dipped below the horizon and Inukai turned the lamp on his desk on, only a few papers remained. No one else in this office could clear a whole desk’s worth of work in a day. Ichiro pulled a great share of the weight in the Seiyukai, and he knew it. His name rarely graced the papers, and few in the public had heard of him, but the Prime Minister had. Inukai relied on Ichiro a great deal to keep the government functioning, and if not for him, his legendary Prime Ministership likely would have ended years ago.\n\nIchiro was the silent workhorse of the Inukai administration not just because of his fast reading and organizational skills, but also for his discretion. As Inukai signed the second to last paper on his desk, he held up the last. He blinked as he read it, face still but heart racing. It was a report. A damning report. Evidence of corruption, bribes, conspiracy, and collaboration within the Seiyukai and between the Seiyukai, Tohokai, and the military. If this leaked to the press, the Inukai administration was over. Previous governments had been brought down by much, much less. Attached to the back of the report by a paperclip was a note from a fresh-faced party recruit he had met two days ago. The note said he had found this report while sorting papers, and didn’t know what it meant, but that he felt Ichiro should look at it. He breathed a sigh of relief. Then he stood up, walked to the wastebasket, and tore the report apart, letting the shredded pieces of paper drift down like cherry blossoms."
 japan_flavor.5.desc:0 ""-and that is why, all things considered, I think we should be adding women’s suffrage to our party platform," Kato Shidzue said, having spoken at length for several minutes. She looked over at Abe Isoo, the only other person in the Diet’s break room. He was reading a newspaper, nodding slowly. "Abe-san? Are you listening?" Abe looked up, meeting her gaze with his good eye. "Oh, um… yes, of course." Kato rolled her eyes and crossed her arms. "Comrade, this is important! What in the newspaper is more important than our party platform?" "Oh, well..." Abe started, pointing out a section of the paper, "Japan had its first professional baseball game today! And we helped sponsor it!" Kato looked at him silently. Abe set the newspaper aside. "I’m sorry, Kato-san. I was very inconsiderate. Please tell me what you were saying."\n\n"I’ve spoken with several diet members and several women’s campaigning groups over the past few months. Women’s suffrage is gaining popularity and becoming a wedge issue with the growth of the feminist movement you and I have fostered." Kato maintained eye contact with Abe to make sure he was still listening. He was. "I estimate that we could gain up to 5 or 10 more seats in the Diet than we would otherwise if we officially added women’s suffrage to our party platform. It would be a major step forward towards normalizing feminism and growing our base of support."\n\nAbe nodded his head, considering this. "Do you think it would alienate many men?" Kato grimaced slightly. "It’s possible, but I think it’s a risk we should take. The speech you gave last month did a lot to dispel the idea that feminism makes you less of a man, however. I think the biggest downside will be that we look more radical to the conservatives." "Not always a bad thing," Abe mused. Kato nodded in agreement. "I think you’re right," Abe said. "Women’s suffrage would probably be a good addition this year. And, even if it doesn’t go as well as we hope..."
 
 japan_konoe.1.desc:0 "Mr. Satou stood near the front of the protest. Before him was the Diet building, locked down and lit up as usual. He heaved to his left, waving the massive Japanese flag he carried over his head. Satou looked around. Most of those around him, chanting and shouting, were young people, liberals, and socialists, not old conservative army veterans like himself. He didn’t mind. Much as he might disagree with these leftist kids, he knew they wanted what was best for Japan. The number of white and red flags showed that much.\n\nThe same could not be said for Konoe. Satou looked up at the Diet building. He knew that that treacherous snake must be up there, watching. Satou clenched his jaw and waved his flag back to the right. It was then that he heard the marching of boots. A line of men was marching along the fence of the courtyard, in front of the crowd. Satou was surprised to see that they were army soldiers, not policemen. He hollered at the teenagers around him to back up and give the men space. Most obliged. The soldiers shoved back those who did not. One soldier held up a bullhorn and shouted, "This gathering has been declared illegal! Return to your homes at once!"\n\n"I fought for our right to protest!" Satou shouted back. "I took a bullet for it! I’m not letting all I fought for be torn down!" The soldiers looked at each other, unsure.\n\n"Please disperse," the soldier with the bullhorn demanded meekly. A young woman in the crowd shouted an obscenity at him, eliciting laughter from many. Not Satou. As he looked at the soldiers, he grew more and more nervous. They were young. Inexperienced. Scared. As the crowd began to move forward again, many of them raised their rifles. Thinking fast, Satou began to sing, and as he did, many in the crowd joined him.\n\n"Kimiga~yo~ wa, chiyo ni~ yachiyo ni, sazare~ ishi-" The gunfire rang out.\n\nSatou was hit in the chest with a bullet, and fell back into the crowd. The people’s singing stopped, and as dozens of people lay dead or dying in the courtyard before the Diet, those who were able fled away from the troops. Satou and his flag lay in a growing pool of blood, the red sun barely visible on the bloody white cloth. As the soldiers moved forward and looked on, Satou sputtered out his last words."
 japan_konoe.2.desc:0 "Professor Iwasaki Chujiro took a sip of his coffee, a taste he acquired while studying in America, and shook his head in disappointment at the morning newspaper. The headline read "Further Police Crackdowns in Tokyo." Iwasaki didn’t know how much worse things could get. The protest he attended at the University last night was set upon with batons by the police, with army soldiers nearby. It felt as if overnight, he had found himself in a dictatorship like Russia or Italy, rather than the democracy of Japan.\n\nIwasaki was not surprised that the government had continued to crack down, but he was surprised when they came knocking on his door. The knocking was so brash and sudden that he nearly jumped out of his seat, spilling his coffee on the table. "Damn. Can you get that, dear?" he asked of his wife, trying to smile but obviously nervous. She silently moved to clean it up. Iwasaki walked to the door and opened it with a forced smile.\n\nBefore him stood two military men, both wearing armbands he didn’t recognize. "Hello," he said. "Are you… military?"\n\n"Kempeitai," the leading man said coldly. "Iwasaki Chujiro-san?"\n\n"Yes, what is-"\n\n"You are under arrest for violating the Public Order and Police Law of 1900. Come with us."\n\nIwasaki was shocked. "Kempeitai? Isn’t that military police? You can’t arrest civilians! I’m a professor, not a soldier!" Iwasaki was a professor of history, not law, so he dearly hoped what he said was true.\n\n"This gun," the Kempeitai agent said, motioning to the pistol holstered on his hip, "has jurisdiction over anything that is in front of it. Come with us willingly or we will take you by force."\n\nIwasaki looked behind him, where his wife and young son peeked back at him nervously. "Please," he said, turning back to the Kempeitai agent. "Let me get some things in order first. I have a family here." The agent’s patience was exhausted. The officer punched Iwasaki square in the jaw, and as the feeble man reeled, the agent grabbed his arm and began pulling him backwards.\n\nHis son rushed forwards, shouting, "Daddy!" His mother grabbed him and pulled him back, with the agents eyeing her suspiciously. She said nothing, despite the tears streaming down her face. She watched helplessly, holding back her son, as her husband was loaded onto the truck and driven away."
 japan_konoe.3.desc:0 "Ittohei Ito walked down the street, Arisaka rifle in hand. He had always wanted to visit Tokyo, even as a child, but he did not ever want to see it like this. The neighborhood looked like a warzone or disaster area after the protest-turned-riot last night. Some buildings had been burned, shops looted, and although the few dead and many wounded had been cleaned up now, some dried pools of blood remained. Ito paused for a moment to take in the sheer devastation present on the deserted road, and was thankful that he wasn’t stationed here when it happened. At that moment, he was startled by a guttural noise emanating from a nearby alleyway. As he approached the alley, he heard an older woman’s voice.\n\n"Quiet, boy, quiet!" she rasped. "You’ll be fine." Ito stepped forward, into the alley, and saw the woman hunched over a young man who was sitting against the wall, his arm wrapped in bandages.\n\n"Are you alright?" Ito asked innocently.\n\n"What does it look like?" the woman snarled at him. "Of course he isn’t alright! Last night, one of you uniformed thugs shot him!"\n\nIto stood in silence for a moment, then continued. "Umm… I have some medical training. Maybe I can help?"\n\n"I think you soldiers have ‘helped’ this city quite enough, thank you!" the woman spat.\n\n"Look, I haven’t shot anyone, ever," said Ito. "Not all of us soldiers like what’s going on here, either!"\n\n"Sure," said the woman sarcastically. "I’m sure not ~all~ of you enjoy shooting civilians. But clearly you’re all okay enough with it that you still show up for duty every day. You don’t quit, or join the protestors. You’re firmly on Konoe’s side in all this! All of you."\n\nIto shot back, annoyed. "What would you civilians do without soldiers? We’re restoring order! The city is in chaos! We’re the only people standing between the citizens and the rioters."\n\nThe woman laughed with incredulous disbelief. "Don’t you get it? The citizens ARE the rioters!" She pointed back at the man against the wall. "This man is a teacher! My husband is a bureaucrat! We were all shot at! Your version of restoring order is killing democracy and freedom, and serving their heads on a platter to Konoe!" She looked Ito dead in the eyes. "Order will only be restored when you and your kind have shot so many innocents that the rest live in fear of you. When it is all over, the people of this country will never forgive you, the soldiers, for your role in this. Not ever."\n\nIto was speechless. The woman turned away from him and helped the man onto his feet, leading him away. Ito sat down in the alleyway to be alone with his thoughts."
 japan_konoe.4.desc:0 "Konoe walked briskly into a meeting room in the Imperial Palace. Before him was His Majesty the Emperor, who stood at his arrival. They both bowed to each other. "I apologize for my lateness, Your Majesty," said Konoe. "My driver was delayed by agitators."\n\n"The whole country has been," said the Emperor coldly. "Konoe-kun, I supported the creation of your government because you promised to restore order. As I think is clear to all, that has not happened. I am second-guessing my decision."\n\n"With all due respect, Your Majesty, it has been only a few weeks. I urge you to wait and see," said Konoe, unblinking. "These are but growing pains for the nation. We knew that communism and western decadence would not die quietly." The Emperor looked directly at Konoe, unimpressed.\n\n"This was not all unavoidable," the Emperor stated. "You could have handled the situation much more gracefully, Konoe-kun. Soldiers at your inauguration? Soldiers in the streets? Soldiers at protests? Everyone is sick of seeing soldiers, and they feel as if they are being occupied. You are treating them like Koreans."\n\n"The nation needs discipline," Konoe insisted. "If the army were not deployed, the city would be in flames."\n\n"If I had supported Saito’s government," the Emperor said, walking to a window, "the army would not have been needed. Unfortunately, I cannot undo that decision." Konoe stood in silence. The Emperor’s insult hurt him deeply. The Emperor turned back to face him. "It would be a political disaster if I dismissed your government now," he continued. "I am stuck with you. I expect better from you. I would think that you, who navigated Japanese politics with the grace and subterfuge of Oni no Hanzo, would know that sometimes a more subtle touch is needed. Put an end to this unrest, by any means necessary, and then handle your position like a noble aristocrat, not a petty tyrant!"\n\nKonoe blinked, remaining stone-faced despite being in the unenviable position of having earned the Emperor’s disfavor. He bowed again. "I swear to you that I will follow these instructions, Your Majesty." As he rose, he continued. "Many of the people may hate me, Your Majesty, but they love you, as all loyal Japanese do. My task could become much easier if you were to openly state your support for ending the unrest. If the people knew that His Majesty the Emperor had instructed me to ‘put an end to this unrest by any means necessary,’ it could change things."\n\nThe Emperor turned back to the window. "Very well," he sighed. "I’ll consider it.""
 japan_konoe.5.desc:0 "Konoe looked out the window of the Diet building. As he’d hoped, several thousand of his supporters had turned out to hear him speak. By staying in the building, he was keeping them waiting. However, as he’d expected, an equally large crowd of protestors had arrived, and were clashing with his supporters on the fringes of the courtyard. After looking on blankly for several more seconds, Konoe turned to one of his subordinates.\n\n"Remove them," he ordered. The man nodded, bowed, and then walked briskly out of the room. For the next several minutes, Konoe watched as a line of policemen separated supporter from protestor, loyalist from traitor. As the traitors were pushed and shoved further and further back, the remaining crowd consisted only of people eager for Konoe’s speech. He stepped outside, onto the balcony, and overlooked the crowd.\n\n"Greetings, loyal Japanese citizens." The people cheered for him. "I have prepared for you wonderful news. The police and Kempeitai have found and arrested large numbers of the dissidents responsible for the recent chaos. The seditious and anti-Japanese influence in our society runs deep, but we are finally doing the work to remove it. Decades of corrupting Western and liberal influence have polluted our country and weakened its institutions. The new government is dedicated to reversing this and making Japan strong again."\n\nThe crowd clapped enthusiastically, with occasional hollers of support. Konoe’s speaking style was not impassioned or enthusiastic, and he knew it, but he tried to lean into this to seem more dignified and authoritative. "I have ordered a commission of scholars to conduct a study about Japanese national identity," Konoe said. "It will detail the nature of the kokutai, our national spirit, and how to revive it after its recent decline. This information, when released, will be the beginning of a great national reviv-"\n\nA gunshot rang out across the courtyard, and a bullet struck the stone railing in front of Konoe on the balcony. His face was sprayed by tiny stone fragments, and he immediately ducked back into the next room, wiping his face clean and shouting for guards. He could hear the crowd descending into chaos as more shots were fired and the police moved in to find the would-be assassin. Konoe cursed under his breath."
 japan_konoe.6.desc:0 "Konoe stood out on the balcony again, watching the Diet building’s servants clean up the last of the debris from the courtyard riot that resulted from the assassination attempt a few weeks ago. The courtyard was nearly as clean as it had been before. Konoe inhaled the fresh Tokyo air. The city almost felt normal again. There was no smoke on the horizon, and he heard no gunshots or chanting. The unrest was over.\n\n"The worst is past," Konoe muttered to himself. "If my government could survive this, we can survive anything." He had an approach he’d used to overcome obstacles for his whole life: change the situation until he was at an advantage, then strike. It had worked for him here once again. For years, he had manipulated Japanese politics from behind the scenes, collaborating with the military and weakening the progressives. Once he was in the Prime Minister’s office, he struck, and no one had the power to resist him. The country was stable. The growing pains had stopped, now the work would begin.\n\nKonoe walked back into the building, where a group of advisors, ministers, and politicians were waiting for him. Among them were Tojo Hideki, the army minister, and the Emperor himself. "Good morning," he said to them. "The situation seems stable. Now we can truly get to work."\n\nTojo stood up. "We have a rot to burn, Konoe-sama," he stated flatly. "Liberalism and western decadence have run deep into Japan’s soil, and we have to pull it out by the roots!"\n\nKonoe looked distastefully at Tojo for his bluntness. The Emperor spoke. "You did a good job dealing with the unrest, Konoe-kun," he said earnestly. "When you said you would honor my commands, I was skeptical. I thought we might see a return to the short-lived governments of the Taisho era. I am pleased to see I was wrong. You have my full support."\n\nKonoe genuinely smiled, something he did not do often. "Thank you, your majesty. With this alliance of the military, the nationalists, and the Emperor, there is nothing we cannot do.""
