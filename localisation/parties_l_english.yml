 insurrectionary_anarchism_subtype_desc:0 "Anarchism is a political philosophy which advocates the abolition of all unjust hierarchy, as well as the destruction of oppressive structures such as governments, capitalism, and bigotry. Insurrectionary Anarchism differs from other strains of anarchist thought because it puts these principles into direct action, not via policy or reform but by immediate, violent revolt against all authority. Insurrectionary Anarchists will rarely ever negotiate with state authorities, and tend towards deliberately chaotic and militaristic."
 revolutionary_autocracy_subtype_desc:0 "Revolutionary Autocracy is an interpretation of Marxist theory which views the Dictatorship of the Proletariat as a license to create an extremely authoritarian and repressive state. Usually ruled by a political vanguard party by means of secret police, military force, and purges, Revolutionary Autocracies are extremely centralized both politically and economically, often ruled by a single leader, and use Marxist thought as the justification for their rule. They often tend toward social conservatism, and no democracy is practiced within such states."
 proletarian_dictatorship_subtype_desc:0 "Favored by most Orthodox Marxists, Communists, and Leninists, Proletarian Dictatorship is a form of government ruled by a vanguard party, which is educated on the doctrines of Marxism and Communism, and leads with a high degree of political and economic centralization, often with a high degree of central planning. Proletarian Dictatorships usually include a restricted form of democracy, such as party membership-based voting, democratic centralism, or limits on acceptable speech."
 libertarian_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "The most moderate of the socialist schools of thought, Libertarian Socialism includes many socialist governments which adopt a less centralized system both politically and economically. Engaging in full-franchise, often direct, democracy and with economies led by either collective or market forces rather than central planning, Libertarian Socialist governments tend to be smaller than other leftist ones. They also tend to be socially progressive, and may include anarchists, communists, socialists, and syndicalists."
 sewer_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "Hailing from Milwaukee, where the term was originally used as an insult, Sewer Socialism is a primarily social-democratic system based upon pragmatism and public outreach. Rejecting calls for revolution of any kind based on their belief that they lack the public support to fully overthrow capitalism, Sewer Socialists prefer to make gains where they can, passing laws to make workers' lives better in material ways, such as setting minimum wages, enforcing safe working conditions, regulating working hours, and using local governments to provide amenities like running water, electricity, and sewer systems to working class areas. Radicals often scoff that Sewer Socialists aren't doing enough to overthrow capitalism, but their short-term benefits for the welfare of the working class are hard to ignore."
 
 social_democracy_subtype_desc:0 "The furthest left among liberal views, Social Democracy adheres generally to a belief in market economics and allows private ownership, but believes in a much larger government than other liberals. Social Democrats argue for extensive welfare states and government programs of regulation and occasionally nationalization to protect and care for their citizens. They also tend towards social progressivism and, despite their nominal support of private enterprise, often align with further-left groups."
 sewer_socialism_socdem_subtype_desc:0 "Hailing from Milwaukee, where the term was originally used as an insult, Sewer Socialism is a primarily social-democratic system based upon pragmatism and public outreach. Rejecting calls for revolution of any kind based on their belief that they lack the public support to fully overthrow capitalism, Sewer Socialists prefer to make gains where they can, passing laws to make workers' lives better in material ways, such as setting minimum wages, enforcing safe working conditions, regulating working hours, and using local governments to provide amenities like running water, electricity, and sewer systems to working class areas. Radicals often scoff that Sewer Socialists aren't doing enough to overthrow capitalism, but their short-term benefits for the welfare of the working class are hard to ignore."
 progressive_liberalism_subtype_desc:0 "Defined by their social progressivism and economic capitalism, Progressive Liberals adhere closely to the classical origins of liberal thought. They believe in enlightenment values such as liberty and equality, and believe the government should play a role in ensuring the equality of various groups, including women, racial minorities, and immigrants. They also are staunch capitalists, believing that the free market and private enterprise will bring growth and development to underprivileged communities."
 market_libertarianism_subtype_desc:0 "Second only to anarchists in their distaste for government power, Market Libertarians view the free market as the ultimate solution to all problems, be they economic or political. Usually pushing for reductions in taxes, spending, and regulation by the government, they put their faith instead in the influence of market forces and corporations. Market Libertarians tend to be fairly apathetic towards social issues, though they may lean one way or another. Ultimately, their primary concerns are with the freedom of the market."
 liberal_conservatism_subtype_desc:0 "Liberal conservatism is a political ideology combining conservative policies with liberal stances, especially on economic, social and ethical issues, representing a brand of political conservatism strongly influenced by liberalism. Liberal conservatism incorporates the classical-liberal view of minimal government intervention in the economy, according to which individuals should be free to participate in the market and generate wealth without government interference. However, liberal conservatism also holds that individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life; therefore, liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation."
 national_liberalism_subtype_desc:0 "National liberalism is a variant of liberalism, combining liberal policies and issues with elements of nationalism. The goals of a national liberal are the pursuit of individual and economic freedom, as well as national sovereignty. At their origin, national liberals, although pro-business, are not necessarily advocates of free trade and economic liberalism per se and sometimes favor cooperation between the government and the national industry, moderate levels of protectionism, the establishment of preferential custom unions, subsidies for infant industry or companies considered of national strategic importance, and various forms of industrial planning."
 national_conservatism_subtype_desc:0 "The furthest right of the liberal ideologies, National Conservatism advocates traditional values, conservative social policy, and nationalistic culture and foreign policy. Usually favoring a capitalist free market with a strong government to protect against other countries, National Conservatives are nationalists first and foremost. They usually oppose social change and immigration, and are skeptical of other nations and cultures. They still nominally support ideas of equality and democracy, however."
 
 authoritarian_demoracy_subtype_desc:0 "Professing the values of democracy and liberty, but practicing an authoritarian, undemocratic political style, Authoritarian Democracy is a contradictory but very common mode of political organizing. The military, a strongman, a populist, or some other political force has suspended civil liberties and operates with unchecked power in a civil dictatorship, running only a sham of democracy, while justifying it with democratic rhetoric, such as "protecting democracy," "maintaining order," and "for national security.""
 autoratic_despotism_subtype_desc:0 "Characterized by overt military rule and a total lack of democracy or civil liberties, Martial Despotism is a style of rule in which an individual, clique, or organization has seized absolute power without meaningful pretense besides that of the force they wield. Including warlords, absolute monarchs, military dictatorships, and more, Martial Despotism is distinguished from other kinds of authoritarianism by its lack of meaningful ideology and brazen, "might makes right" attitude."
 fundamentalist_theocracy_subtype_desc:0 "Deriving its mandate to rule and political doctrines solely on a religious basis, Fundamentalist Theocracy is a self-justifying and nebulous form of government. Usually but not always socially reactionary, these Theocrats are still deeply opposed to secularism, foreign religions, and disruptive social change. Fundamentalist Theocrats can be of any religion and hold nearly any specific policy positions, but are differentiated from other ideologies due to their strict adherence to a religious text or doctrine that forms the basis of their politics."
 far_right_authoritarianism_subtype_desc:0 ""
 fascism_subtype_desc:0 "Representing the most destructive and hateful tendencies of humanity, Ultranationalism is characterized by extreme authoritarianism, belief in racial or national supremacy, aggressive and belligerent posturing, and a thirst for violence. Though its specific beliefs are often nonsensical or contradictory, the core of Ultranationalism is not ideology or reason, but hatred and fear. It usually manifests in the form of extremely authoritarian and militaristic national states with expansionist, often genocidal ambitions."
 fascism_subtype_desc:0 "Fascism is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and of the economy. Fascists saw the Great War as a revolution that brought massive changes to the nature of war, society, the state, and technology. The advent of total war and the total mass mobilization of society had broken down the distinction between civilians and combatants. A military citizenship arose in which all citizens were involved with the military in some manner during the war. The war had resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines and providing economic production and logistics to support them, as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens."
