 redliberty.1.desc:0 "Reedus was laying in the tall grass in the middle of the summer night, around 12 AM. The dirt he was laying on was wet, moist, and just had a weird feeling in-general. In his hands he held an M1897 shotgun, the same one he used for hunting. It gave him some memories, fond memories, memories that would have him laugh out loud if it wasn't for self-control. He quickly shook these thoughts off.\n“When do you think the convoy will come? They come this way every night.” A fellow man-in-arms asked another.\n“I don’t know, but when they do you better shut up before they hear you, otherwise you’re gonna get us all killed.” A different man responded, seemingly offended.\n“Don’t you worry your little asses about it. There engines will be roaring by the time they get here, ain’t that right Reedus?” The fellow man-in-arms asked him.\n“Billy will you shut up? I think I see headlights off in the distance. Over there!” He yelled in a whisper.\nIt was showtime, finally time to see whether or not he would live to see the next day in Alabama and see that sun one more time. Slowly, almost to a crawl, the truck inched forward, blind of the road ahead due to their resistance efforts. If they were willing to go this far with no headlights then those supplies HAVE to be important. Right? The truck gained ground closer and closer to Reedus and his squad of two others. Pretty soon he would step out onto the path of the supply truck and order them to stop, if they don't, well… hopefully his bullets will kill the driver.\nThis was it, the moment they’ve all been waiting for, Reedus quickly stepped out onto the dirt road and, now thinking first, fired his shotgun into the windshield, hitting and killing the passenger sitting in the passenger seat, entering through his eye and ending up in his brain. The driver wasn’t so lucky, his entire face was blown off, blood strewn everywhere inside as well as twitching like a madman. The driver, being dead, lost control of his foot and his hands and crashed right into a nearby tree, making sure they were dead by crushing their chests.\n“Jeesus Christ! What did they ever do to you!?” Billy yelled at Reedus.\n“By living! That’s what they did!” Reedus instantly ran to the back of the destroyed supply truck to check out the goods. What they found though was beyond their expectations. Gas shells, to be used for artillery against notable rebel hotspots. Ideas raced through Reedus’ mind but were quickly cut short by Billy, telling Reedus, “Yo, we gotta go, there’s a whole band of them Yankees up ahead.” Billy and Reedus raced out of there and into the darkness of the night into the field, not knowing what to do with the information they collected tonight."
