 ### EVENTS ###
 france_far_right.1.desc:0 "After over sixty years of Republican rule and the effective disappearance of overt monarchism in the French political scene, it was thought that its return was impossible. That belief was mistaken.\n\nToday, members of the Action Française entered the largely-vacant Palais du Luxembourg and Palais Bourbon, allowed entry by their comrades who already had seats in the government, and declared themselves as being the new government of France by virtue of simply occupying the halls of government.\n\nThe military seems onboard, although a vocal minority of the population is less than enthused by this turn of events, and of course virtually all of the republicans parties have declared the new regime illegitimate, to which leaders of Action Française have snidely remarked that, if they loved their republic so much, perhaps they should not have abandoned it by resigning their posts.\n\nThe leader of Action Française, Charles Maurras, has been declared regent in a ceremony that blended both ancient themes with modern political language, evoking the glory of the Ancien Régime while also calling for “national rejuvenation”. This bizarre blending of the old and the new was, fittingly, broadcast on radio and television for all French people to see and hear.\n\nHaving achieved this position by making their particular brand of monarchy as vague and inclusive as possible, it is, as of yet, unknown which of the three major royal families, the Bourbons, the Orléanists, or the Bonapartes, will be crowned. What is certain is that the Third Republic is now, officially, dead."
 
 france_far_right.2.desc:0 "It started at the crack of dawn. In every city in France, thousands of black-clad men and women took to the streets, waving black banners with a white cross and skull on them and chanting “Social d'abord!” At first it was assumed that this was just one of the many protests that the government faces on a monthly basis.\n\nBut from the start, this was something more.\n\nForming in the outlying suburbs and villages and then moving inwards to be joined by Parisians, a huge procession of supporters of the Croix-de-Fue began to make their way into the city, spearheaded by veterans of the Great War who were armed with antiquated rifles and pistols.\n\nThe Ground Army has explicitly refused to aid the government, apparently unwilling to shoot at their former comrades in arms. The Paris police and gendarmes held out for several hours, assisted, in a strange twist of fate, by several socialist and communist militias, but were eventually forced back by the sheer size of the crown. Street-fighting was fierce, but was mostly close-quarters, with clubs and fists, and so deaths were few and far between.\n\nOnce the crowd reached the Palais du Luxembourg and the Palais Bourbon, they surrounded the buildings and presented their sole demand: That their leader, François de La Rocque, be named as president of the republic.\n\nFaced with a mob hundreds of thousands strong, and with the armed forces standing idly by, the government felt that they had no choice but to acquiesce to the demand.\n\nSo ends the current iteration of Europe’s grandest republic; brought down in the same manner as Italy was. We can only hope that the new regime does not emulate their Roman counterparts too closely."
