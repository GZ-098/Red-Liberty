 italy_events.1.t:0 "The Beginning of the Revisions"
 italy_events.1.d:0 "Mussolini paced back and forth in his office, his hands clasped behind his back as he stared at floor; at his shiny black boots stomping against the aged wood. There were whispers coming through to him, from confidants, friends, colleagues, and of course the OVRA, that there were those in the Grand Council of Fascism that were plotting against him and his government.\n\nThe Duce tapped his fingers together in agitation as he paced. This was no good. There were too many damn compromises and opposing viewpoints in the government. He’d had to agree to allow the king to retain his crown to appease the army, he’d had to keep liberal and conservative legislators and bureaucrats in the government, even after the Acerbo Law.\n\nHis cheeks were flushing with anger as his frown hardened into a scowl. And now, talk of treason in the grand council itself. No word yet on who was doing the plotting, but Mussolini could guess. \n\nFinally, he came to a resolution on the matter. Sitting down at his desk, he picked up a pen and a blank sheet of paper and began coming up with a list of names in his head. The first one was Michele Bianchi. An obvious choice.\n\nThe lines of the dictator’s scowl etched deeper into his face as he wrote that man’s name. Yes, yes he was quite suspect. Even now, he was an unashamed syndicalist. Mussolini had put his socialist path long behind him, but this red revolutionary was still agitating from within their very party. He was, undoubtedly, the source of the rot.\n\nThe gears turned in his mind as he wrote. Michele had struggled with tuberculosis years ago, and it had come terribly close to killing him. And it was not unheard of for tuberculosis which had previously been in remission to return. Yes, Michele would disappear. Officially to a private residence to try and heal from the recurring tuberculosis. And, tragically, he would “fail”. A rival removed; stability maintained.\n\nMussolini smiled grimly, and began writing more names."

 redliberty.1.desc:0 "”McKinley Narrowly Evades Assassination Attempt!”, was the all the craze back in 1901, when an Anarchist by the name of Leon Czolgosz, was quickly apprehended when an eagled eyed Secret Service bodyguard spotted the gun in Czolgosz’s sleeve. After an average Second Term of McKinley with no Social Reforms, the masses soon turned to the Progressive “Golden Boy” of the Democrats, William Randolph Hearst, however after a corruption scandal between Hearst’s “Investigation” on Republican Senator Robert A. Taft, a impeachment hearing was called on Hearst, revealing bribes and Yellow Journalism was apart of him, and so Hearst was impeached as President for Corruption. Former Vice-President, now President Henry Davis pardoned Hearst, however that Pardon wasn’t popular with the masses at all, as they demanded Hearst would be put in Prison for his corruption. The Masses turned to another third party for the upcoming 1909 elections, the Socialist Party USA, after Capitalism and Progressivism failed them, and so in the closest elections in American History, one vote away from being not elected, renowned pacifist Eugene V. Debs from the Socialist Party becomes the 28th President of the United States, and so he started his reforms to start to turn the Capitalist run Democracy into a Socialist one."
 redliberty.2.t:0 "The inauguration of Norman Thomas" 
 redliberty.2.d:0 "The president-elect stood before a massive, cheering crowd on the Washington Mall. His hands rested easily on the podium; this is, after all, his second time up here. “Ladies and gentlemen!” He announces into the microphone, silencing the rapturous applause that had heralded his ascent.\n \n“I stand before you today humbled and grateful. Humbled by the many millions that have pledged their support to me, and to the Socialist Party and all of its candidates. And I am grateful for the providence of our Lord, who has shown me the way here.”\n \n He paused for a moment, letting the cacophonous applause wash over him and up the steps of the Capitol. He didn’t turn around, but he smiled at the thought of the legislators behind him hearing the thunderous approval from the crowd. It would cow them; send them a message that the socialists were here to stay, and beloved by the people.\n \n His eyes wandered over the assembled masses. Some were holding flags and banners; mostly for the Socialist Party, but there were a few from the Socialist Labor Party, the Farmer-Labor Party, the Progressive Party, and Communist Party. He tacitly disapproved of the final one but had avoided disavowing them while on the campaign trail. If they would support him, then he would let them, but he sure as hell wasn’t going to give them anything for it.\n \n The unions were out in force too. The American Federation of Labor was, of course, present, as was the redoubtable Industrial Workers of the World, with their red and black banners, and there was even a single banner for the infirm and aging Knights of Labor.\n \n Parties and unions; they’d all been fighting decades for this, for a time when one of their own could sit in the White House. Debs had been a monumental victory, as had his reelection. But Thomas was a victory too. He was a statement, the socialists would not burn hot and short but were here to stay." 
 redliberty.3.t:0 "The Inevitable Compromise" 
 redliberty.3.d:0 "President Thomas stared down at the sheet of paper on his desk, looking over the names that had been drawn up for potential cabinet appointments. \n \n The election results had been good, but not perfect, and had planted a seed of doubt in the president’s mind. If the Socialist Party was truly to become America’s leading party then it would need popular support. More so, at least, than it currently had. \n \n Thomas sighed, leaning back in his chair and rubbing the bridge of his nose in frustration. They needed popular support to make changes, and to get popular support they needed to change things. A snake eating its own tail. A cycle that couldn’t be broken, and would probably doom the party unless they could. Talking about change was all well and good, but real change would be needed if they were to retain the position the people had voted them into. \n \n So, the goal was simple, get more voters. Widen the party’s appeal. He looked down at the paper again. Perhaps just a few small tweaks here and there to the party’s platform. Nothing major, of course. Socialism as an end goal wasn’t going anywhere. But a splash of populism would do them some good with the less radical voters. Reaching for his pen, he scrawled two more names in the margins of the page Henry Wallace and Wendell Willkie. One Democrat, one Republican, both agreeable."
 redliberty.4.t:0 "A Socialist Cabinet it will be!" 
 redliberty.4.d:0 "President Thomas stared down at the sheet of paper on his desk, looking over the names that had been drawn up for potential cabinet appointments. \n \n The election results had been good, but not perfect, and had planted a seed of doubt in the president’s mind. If the Socialist Party was truly to become America’s leading party then it would need popular support. More so, at least, than it currently had. \n \n Thomas stared down at the list and smiled. It was a grand who’s who of socialist mainstays, from W.E.B. Du Bois to Emma Goldman. \n \n It was a radical list, to be sure. A more radical government had never been assembled since Lincoln’s day. But these were radical times, and it wouldn’t do to stick with stodgy liberal-capitalist political thinking. That was a dying breed, and Thomas had no wish to resuscitate it. \n \n The cabinet he was putting together would be unconventional, and Goldman’s inclusion would definitely raise some eyebrows, but it would show the people that, without a doubt, the Socialist Party was committed to socialism and the liberation of all men and women. \n \n That was the only real way to gain popular support, Thomas decided, leaning back in his chair with a smile on his face. Appeal to the people directly, and show them that the Socialist Party had their interests at heart first and foremost, not the pleadings and mutterings of the capitalist parties." 
 redliberty.5.t:0 "Our Plans for this Presidency?" 
 redliberty.5.d:0 "President Thomas looked out of the White House window, gazing over the National Mall. Siegfried’s Funeral March played on a gramophone in the background. It had felt appropriate for the thoughts he was mulling over.\n\n He had plans for his presidency. Major plans. Schemes ran wild through his head.\n\nSocialism, true socialism, must be born and must endure in the United States. And Thomas intended to see that through. It was imperative that the Socialist Party endure and remain influential. That was the only way that they would ever be able to carry out their plans.\n\nTo that end, he had devised a simple, two pronged-plan. Prong one was to pass a Workplace Socialization Bill into law, and if possible, write it into the Constitution itself to make sure it could not easily be undone. Prong two was to attack voter suppression, especially in the south. He and Du Bois had come up with a plan wherein they would pass federal laws prohibiting all forms of voter suppression, specifically aimed at the south. “Literacy tests” and poll taxes would be wiped away, and lynchings would be investigated directly by the FBI.\n\nOfficially these programs wouldn’t be racially based, and it was true enough that they would aid the poor whites in the south in voting, which might also be helpful. But the true aim was to re-enfranchise the southern blacks, who would then hopefully vote Socialist in large enough numbers to give their party a plurality in local and national elections so that the socialists would be able to continue protecting their rights.\n\nThat was the plan, anyway." 
 redliberty.6.t:0 "Reviewing the Constitution" 
 redliberty.6.d:0 "Men and women sit in a meeting room in the White House, seated comfortably around a large oaken table. The newly inaugurated president entered, to smiles and nods and a few acknowledging murmurs of "Comrade". \n \n Taking a seat at the head of the table, Norman Thomas reviews the assembled cabinet. Men and women of all origins, and even an African American, W.E.B. Du Bois himself, stared back. \n \n "Comrades," the president began, "We now find ourselves seated in the very halls of power we swore to tear down. Before us lies the task of reforming this great country, and serving the people who have duly elected us. To that end, I suggest we start small and modest." He pulled a pamphlet from his pocket, the words "The Constitution of the United States of America" were printed on its cover. "I believe that there are some parts of the Constitution we should review." \n \n A chuckle passed around the table, and they got down to work." 
 redliberty.7.t:0 "The End of an Era" 
 redliberty.7.d:0 "Charles Curtis lay in a hospital bed in Washington D.C. There was a dull ache in his chest. He’d had a heart attack, he’d been told by the doctors. They’d given him some morphine for the pain, which had gone from a horrible splitting sensation down to a gentle, unpleasant throb. \n \n But his mind wasn’t on the discomfort in his chest. \n \n He was alone in his room; the doctors and nurses having long since left to attend other duties. He could see the American flag waving from the flagpole outside his second-story window. The cable that secured it to the pole clanked gently in the breeze. It sounded almost like a bell. \n \n The sun was shining brightly and merrily. A beam of light was resting on his hand. It felt so warm and pleasant, like the hand of his wife, who’d always been there for him. Until she had gone to join the angels. \n \n Charles had been told that he was going to be alright, but he didn’t believe that. The doctors had their machines and their books, but he was the one living in this body. And he could tell that this was going to be the end. \n \n His chest started to hurt again, but not because of the attack. He wasn’t ready to die. His children had been informed, and they were coming to see him. That was important, but it wasn’t what was paining him. \n \n The flag whipped tumultuously in a gust of wind. It was silly, but for a moment Charles worried that it would tear away from the pole. And if that wasn’t an apt metaphor for America, then he didn’t know what was. Being yanked this way and that by socialists and nationalists, all so eager to rock the boat. Sooner or later they would tear the country apart, and the entire nation would come crashing down, and cities which hadn’t known war for their entire existence would be devastated by it.The idea clawed at his mind and his eyes began to burn, but no tears would come. Families torn apart, brothers at each other’s throats. The entire country ripped asunder, and perhaps even made a playground for other nations, who would be more than happy to support one side or another. And what would be left at the end of it all? Ashes and tears and broken dreams. That was always what these radicals left in their wake. \n \n His soul longed to be in the halls of power once again, to be surrounded by white marble as he and his colleagues steered the ship of state safely through the storm; and in that moment he was very nearly able to will his body out of the bed and onto his feet. But he collapsedback onto the pillow, having barely even managed to sit up. \n \n No, this was the end for him, and maybe even the end of the country he’d devoted his life to. There was still a ray of hope for America. But not for him. Not anymore. He’d done what he could in the time he’d been given, and now others would either preserve or destroy what he’d built. \n \n He shut his eyes, and willed his grief and guilt away. There was no use for it. There was nothing he could do now, and regret wouldn’t change the past. Warmth flowed through him, and he opened his eyes again to see that same beam of light caressing his hand. It was time. He looked out again at the flag, then closed his eyes and went to join his wife."
 redliberty.8.t:0 "The Inauguration of Lister Hill" 
 redliberty.8.d:0 "Joseph Lister Hill climbed up to the podium, his hands resting on the podium as he rapped his fingers against it; eager to begin his speech. The last Democrat who’d been properly elected had been Hearst. Hill didn’t despise Hearst as some of his party did. Indeed, he admired Hearst’s populism and his appeals to the working class. That was, after all, the only way to effectively fight the socialists, on their home soil. \n \n “My fellow Americans,” he began, speaking slowly and clearly into the microphone, “we are here today in recognition of a great victory, We have taken back the soul of America from the vile talons of the red menace!” \n \n Cheers and applause erupted from the gathered onlookers below. “So, my fellow Americans, we now enter a new chapter in the history of our great country! We must put aside the inconsequential squabbles of the past; America will never be a socialist nation! \n \n “Instead, it is time to look to our future! There remains only one question left to us, How best to serve the United States of America? What we need, my fellow Americans, is to solve two crucial issues, The issue of medicine, and the issue of race. These shall be the defining questions of my administration, and solutions are available for both! \n \n “Some of my more idealistic cohorts in congress might favor a particularly rash solution to the question of the status of the American Negro; Full integration with white society. Citizens of America, this is laughable. We must of course go with the age-old wisdom; Separate but Equal, which has kept the south peaceful and tranquil for almost 60 years now! \n \n “And then there is the question of medicine. We live in a modern age, with modern afflictions. There are, undoubtedly, many among you who remember the tragic pandemic of 1918. The only way I see to counter such peculiarities of modernity is with a modern medical system! Affordable care for all Americans. Men and women of America, the future is bright!”"
 afghan.1.d:0 "Fighting broke off across the nation today as various Pashtun tribes rose up in opposition to Emir Kalakani. The rebels, organized by the Musahiban brothers, claim to support the exiled King Amanullah and his claim to the throne. As more and more tribes swap to the side of the so called Amanites it seems as if King Amanullah may have a chance. In response to this Emir Kalakani and his Saqqawists assembled an army of Tajik loyalists, he shows no intentions of stepping down. "
