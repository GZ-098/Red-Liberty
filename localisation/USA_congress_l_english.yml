When he'd gotten older, he'd gone down into the mines himself.\n\nAnd, as had many other West Virginian coal miners, he'd gotten caught up in the whirlwind of political radicalism. His brother had been at Blair Mountain, and he himself was a proud redneck; a socialist organizer and unionizer. He'd voted for Norman Thomas in '32, and intended to do so again in this year's elections.\n\nWhat he was really excited for today was the social security bill. It would be a godsend to folks like him, who did hard labor for a living. They needed the money when they retired; the hard, unforgiving work often left their bodies broken, and he knew too many people who relied on charity and church donations to survive in their old age. A monthly payment would be a godsend.\n\nHe searched through the paper's pages, feeling more and more dejected until, finally, he found what he was looking for: a small article on the next to last page about the voting on the bill. It... it had succeeded!\n\nA wave of relief washed over Harold, and he leaned back in his chair, casting his eyes up at the ceiling as a grin spread across his face. “Thank you, Lord!” He leaned back forward to continue reading the short article, which was mostly about what the social security bill would do. He felt immensely grateful; to God, to Norman Thomas, and of course to the Socialist Party. Now he wouldn't feel pain in his heart when he saw those old men in church, bent double in ragged clothes, unable to support themselves.\n\nA new day was slowly dawning, and it seemed bright."
